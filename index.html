  <p>For the past two years, my friends have had a tradition of making predictions and scoring them at the end of the year. This year, I decided why not just post my predictions on my blog and score them publicly (with a few redacted)? This will hopefully incentivize me to be more thoughtful about them and also will help direct my endless desire for internet acclaim towards something that has a positive side effect.</p>

  <p>Previously: Upcoming Maniac Week.
Summary Inspired by Nick Winter, Bethany Soule, Danny Reeves, Brent Yorgey, and Alex Strick, I undertook a &ldquo;maniac week&rdquo; from Friday, October 9th (9:00 AM) through Thursday, October 15th (12:00 PM). During my maniac week, I worked 11+ hours a day on schoolwork and my primary research project while avoiding social media and other internet distractions.
By my own assessment, my maniac week was a success. Despite not working nearly as many hours as Nick Winter, I got everything I needed to done, learned that I could work as much as I did, and observed the challenges working a lot entails.</p>

  <p>Note: Ignore the weird Markdown formatting, it’s because I copied this from the blog source code.
Inspiration: Understanding by Nabeel Qureshi, David Deutsch&rsquo;s The Beginning of Infinity and Fun Criterion.
Meta: This is an experimental post in which I dissect something about myself rather than write about some technical topic. Feedback and criticism encouraged as always!
One commonality I&rsquo;ve noticed amongst profiles of thinkers I respect&ndash;Richard Feynman, John Von Neumann, David Deutsch, Donald Knuth, George Church&ndash;is that these folks enjoy(ed) “thinking as play”.</p>

  <p>This semester, I had the pleasure of taking a course on Causal Inference with Professor Elias Bareinboim, one of Judea Pearl&rsquo;s former students and author of some seminal results in Causal Inference. I feel like this course highlighted not only the content Causal Inference researchers consider important but also the types of understanding they value. In this review, I&rsquo;ll focus on the latter. I hope to write some blog posts in the future about the former but have learned from past experience not to promise future posts unless I have time during which I know I can write them.</p>
