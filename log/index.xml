      <description>Not nearly as productive as yesterday. Spent a bunch of time reading about synthetic biology in the morning rather than doing Calculus.
Had a good session learning about probability. Was referred to Terry Tao&amp;rsquo;s notes on rigorous probability theory as a supplement to the book I&amp;rsquo;m reading. Feeling excited about diving into them.
Got around half-way through Calculus Problem Set #2, hoping to finish tomorrow and maybe get in 1-2 lectures.</description>

      <description>Post-Lunch So far, much more productive than yesterday, finished Problem Set #2 and went through the Exam 1 review lecture for Calculus. Currently debating whether I should take the exam today or wait until tomorrow. I&amp;rsquo;d like to do some probability, but also want to make sure I&amp;rsquo;m making adequate progress, in particular while my motivation&amp;rsquo;s still relatively high.
In the afternoon, I&amp;rsquo;m going to try to finish the probability exercises from Section 1.</description>
