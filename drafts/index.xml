      <description>This is the first post in a three part series. When the two subsequent parts are written, I&amp;rsquo;ll add links to them here.
Reading biographies and observing friends, family, and colleagues has led me to the inescapable conclusion that cognitive stamina and base levels of energy vary widely amongst individuals. Identifying the biological or environmental factors which produce this difference seems important and neglected. Understanding this is a research agenda&amp;rsquo;s worth of work, so my contribution in this three part series will be to draw a conceptual boundary around the idea of an &amp;ldquo;energetic alien&amp;rdquo;, provide examples of eminent energetic aliens from different fields, discuss some hypotheses about the energetic alien phenomenon, and then put forth some ideas for how us non-energetic aliens can compensate.</description>
