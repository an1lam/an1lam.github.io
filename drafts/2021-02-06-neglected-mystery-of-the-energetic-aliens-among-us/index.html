</h1>




</section>



<section><p><em>This is the first post in a three part series. When the two subsequent parts are written, I&rsquo;ll add links to them here.</em></p>
<p>Reading biographies and observing friends, family, and colleagues has led me to the inescapable conclusion that cognitive stamina and base levels of energy vary widely amongst individuals. Identifying the biological or environmental factors which produce this difference seems important and neglected. Understanding this is a research agenda&rsquo;s worth of work, so my contribution in this three part series will be to draw a conceptual boundary around the idea of an &ldquo;energetic alien&rdquo;, provide examples of eminent energetic aliens from different fields, discuss some hypotheses about the energetic alien phenomenon, and then put forth some ideas for how us non-energetic aliens can compensate.</p>
<p>As with almost any interesting topic, Robin Hanson <a href="https://www.overcomingbias.com/2019/09/stamina-succeeds.html">has gotten here first</a>. I definitely recommend reading his post if you haven&rsquo;t already. His post has the typical to-the-point Robin style, whereas mine seeks to be a bit more comprehensive.</p>

<strong>Neon, flashing disclaimer</strong>: Writing about biological differences, even done carefully, has been known to get people into trouble. While I hope to avoid this since I&rsquo;m mostly focused on these individual extreme outliers, I still feel obligated to state outright that I <strong>do not</strong> think that having more energy makes a person more morally valuable or worthy of special treatment. Related to this, I realize that this post could be cynically viewed as a status-raising exercise in disguise. To prevent such a view from spreading, let me state outright that I am trying to raise awareness of this phenomenon but I <strong>am not trying to raise the status of the &ldquo;energetic aliens&rdquo; I discuss in this post</strong>. As probably comes through in my writing, I find the examples and stories I share fascinating and would be lying if I said I wasn&rsquo;t a bit jealous of the stamina some of these people possess. But in terms of status, identifying these outliers has, if anything, lowered their status&rdquo; in my mind because I&rsquo;ve realized that discussions of &ldquo;grit&rdquo; ignore what seem to be hard-to-change or at least under-discussed factors.  </span></p>
<p>Before diving into examples of energetic aliens, it&rsquo;s important to define what type of person qualifies as one. With the caveat that any such definition runs into the fundamental nebulosity of definitions, energetic aliens are people who mostly satisfy the first two following criteria and occasionally the third:</p>
<ol>
<li>Able to indefinitely sustain focus on cognitive tasks for more than the usual 4-6 hours a day without burning out or starting to make tons of mistakes.</li>
<li>Often described as full of energy or having an abundance of energy.</li>
<li>(Optional) Can function well while getting &lt;=6 hours of sleep.</li>
</ol>
<p>While all three of these criteria rule out large swaths of the population, I believe 1 to be the most narrowing. Many people I know go through periods during which they work more than average but a smaller subset of them seem to be able to do so without their focus taking a hit and/or it taking a toll on them in the longer term. An even smaller number seem to be able to do this for cognitively stretching work <em>and</em> maintain their cognitive flexibility.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll discuss this more in part 2 and 3, but as a preview, I&rsquo;m still quite uncertain about what set of factors and interactions turn someone into an energetic alien. My initial investigations have pushed me in the direction of thinking that it&rsquo;s partly out of one&rsquo;s control but may require other necessary conditions which are more in one&rsquo;s control. Concretely, certain people may have the potential for energetic alien-ness but fail to actualize it due to working on something that they find boring, unengaging, or meaningless.</p>
<p>In the following sections, after hopefully convincing you that I&rsquo;m not an energetic alien and therefore that this isn&rsquo;t all a status-raising exercise in disguise, I share a bunch of stories and quotes I&rsquo;ve gathered about individuals who satisfy the energetic alien criteria. By drawing examples from different domains and simply observing their characteristics, I hope we can avoid jumping to premature explanations for the energetic alien phenomenon and instead let our curiosity guide us.</p>
<h1 id="case-studies-in-energy">Case studies in energy</h1>
<h2 id="personal">Personal</h2>
<h3 id="a-personal-energy-auto-biography">A personal energy auto-biography</h3>
<p>By any reasonable definition, I&rsquo;m not one of these &ldquo;energetic aliens&rdquo;. To prove it, here&rsquo;s a list of Stephen&rsquo;s personal limitations. I need &gt;=7.5 hours of sleep to do hard thinking (e.g. math). I top out at 4-6 hours of coding straight even when I&rsquo;m really engaged in what I&rsquo;m doing. I&rsquo;ve never <strong>consistently</strong> worked more than 50-60 hours of week. I can&rsquo;t productively pull all-nighters without seriously degrading my focus, even when I really need to.</p>
<p>In fact, some of my biggest failures in life have come from tricking myself into thinking I could behave like an energetic alien. For example, in college, I&rsquo;d often struggle with problem set classes because I&rsquo;d procrastinate and then run out of stamina trying to brute force my way through them at the last minute.</p>
<p>If anything, realizing I&rsquo;m not an energetic alien has helped me consciously compensate for my limitations. Over the years, I&rsquo;ve found a bunch of strategies that seem to help me efficiently use and maximize my energy given what feel like fairly hard limitations:</p>
<ul>
<li>Protect my mornings so that I can do focused work when I&rsquo;m freshest.</li>
<li>Do my best, but often fail, to limit browsing the internet, since that diffuses my focus.</li>
<li>Loosely follow an intermittent fasting schedule because fasting helps me maintain a focused state.</li>
<li>Carefully plan to avoid having to sprint for last minute deadlines as much as possible.</li>
<li>Implement compensating strategies that assume I&rsquo;ll make more mistakes the more I stretch my energetic limits.</li>
<li>Pick jobs &amp; areas of focus which reward system-building and plodding over long periods of time rather than repeated short sprints.</li>
<li>Avoid committing to too many different activities, projects, etc.</li>
<li>Seek to increase depth of focus rather than length.</li>
</ul>
<p>That said, I also don&rsquo;t want to profess false humility or falsely victimize myself. Some people have it much worse and still overcome their limitations to do incredible work. As <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2003/07/07/a-sudden-illness">this article</a> about Laura Hillenbrand discusses, she has a chronic fatigue impairment which makes it nearly impossible for her to keep to a consistent writing schedule, yet she manages to write popular, thorough, and fascinating books like Seabiscuit and Unbroken.</p>
<h3 id="aliens-in-my-own-life">Aliens in my own life</h3>
<p>Some of my closest friends and family members put me to shame in terms of energy levels. My girlfriend has, by necessity, gone through multiple periods during which she works 12-16 hour days 6 days a week and sleeps 5-6 hours a night. While it definitely takes a toll and therefore she may not fully qualify for the alien ranks, she&rsquo;s managed it without degrading her work quality in a job which requires high levels of detail orientation.</p>
<p>Similarly, my dad claims that, as a corporate law associate in his 20s, he consistently worked up to 20 hour days while sleeping ~4 hours a night and doing difficult cognitive work like correcting legal M&amp;A documents. At least as he remembers it, despite this, the short deadlines and intensity of the work meant that he didn&rsquo;t notice being tired or cognitively impaired throughout.</p>
<p>Like many doctors, my maternal grandfather also seems to have been blessed with a wellspring of energy. Back in the age of the iron intern, he worked &gt;10 hour shifts as a resident and claims that his prodigious memory was mostly not impacted.</p>
<p>When asked, my girlfriend, dad, and grandpa, all say that despite working long hours continuously while sleep deprived, they often wouldn&rsquo;t notice dips in energy due to something like adrenaline keeping them focused.</p>
<h2 id="biology">Biology</h2>
<p>Of the sciences with which I&rsquo;m familiar, biology seems to be the one with the highest density of energetic aliens. The upper echelons of biology seem packed with people who have a miraculous ability to work incredibly hard while remaining cognitively flexible and creative. Perhaps this results from biology&rsquo;s interleaving of the physical and cognitive? Let&rsquo;s look at some examples.</p>
<h3 id="george-church">George Church</h3>
<p>George Church is a biologist (and disclaimer, a co-founder of my employer) famous for, among other things:</p>
<ul>
<li>Publishing the first direct genomic sequencing method (with Wally Gilbert).</li>
<li>Pioneering multiplex genome sequencing &amp; engineering techniques.</li>
<li>Playing a role in the initial optimization and &ldquo;productionalization&rdquo; of CRISPR.</li>
<li>Accelerating and improving DNA synthesis.</li>
<li>Helping to initiate the Human Genome Project.</li>
<li>Founding a lot of companies.</li>
<li>Trying to create a viral-immune genome.</li>
<li>Trying to revive wooly mammoths.</li>
<li>And much more!</li>
</ul>
<p>Based on his own interviews, it&rsquo;s clear that George Church qualifies as an &ldquo;energetic alien&rdquo;. After finishing his undergrad in 2 years, George Church worked 100 hour weeks in the lab during grad school (<a href="https://bit.ly/32aJROl">source</a>), famously getting kicked out due to not attending classes because he was just so absorbed in his research. This level of focus seems to be something that George has continued to be able to access throughout his life. Elsewhere, he discusses how he gets so engaged in his work that he forgets to eat for days (<a href="https://www.sciencefriday.com/articles/10-questions-for-george-church-geneticist/">source</a>) if noone&rsquo;s around to remind him:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Veganism is a little difficult to maintain when you travel, but the fact is with my metabolism, I don’t really need to eat more than once every couple of days anyway. Sometimes I’ll miss all the meals in a day. I just forget about it, especially if my family is not around. I get focused on one particular topic that I obsess about, and if there’s nothing that will interrupt me. I just keep going.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Like some of the other examples we&rsquo;ll look at, George Church self-identifies as non-neurotypical. In addition to his preternaturally deep focus, he has narcolepsy and dyslexia. While the former is inconvenient when it causes him to fall asleep temporarily during panels or conversations, he&rsquo;s cited it as an enabler of his creativity. <a href="https://www.statnews.com/2017/06/08/george-church-narcolepsy/#:~:text=He%20hasn't%20tried%20any,for%20me%2C%E2%80%9D%20Church%20said.">This</a> Stat News article has a bunch of good quotes about this. Here are a few of my favorites:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Church said “almost all” of his visionary ideas and scientific solutions have come while he was either asleep or quasi-asleep, sometimes dreaming, at the beginning or end of a narcoleptic nap. Such as? The <a href="http://science.sciencemag.org/content/309/5741/1728">breakthrough</a> during graduate school that ushered in “next gen” genome sequencing, a fast and cheap way to “read” DNA. “<a href="https://www.statnews.com/2016/06/02/project-human-genome-synthesis/">Writing genomes</a>,” or constructing them from off-the-shelf molecules as a way to improve on what nature came up with. Innovations in <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC179534/pdf/1796228.pdf">editing genomes</a>.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Or when his computer acts up, he takes it as a sign from the universe to shut down not only the machine but also himself, by sitting or lying down. “Then, when I wake up, I’ll have the solution to either the scientific problem or the computer problem,” he said.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Unexpectedly, narcolepsy also seems to enable Church&rsquo;s extraordinary work habits. Asked about whether he got tired during his grad school 100 hour work weeks, Church said that he would just fall asleep while working in the lab and wake up and continue (I think this was on 60 minutes, but unfortunately I can&rsquo;t access it because of a paywall). This suggests that the flipside of the narcoleptic&rsquo;s inability to control sleep is the lack of issues around needing the right environment to sleep.</p>
<p>While Church&rsquo;s dyslexia seems less connected to his alien status, it is also worth noting that his ability to focus seems to have helped him compensate for his slower reading. From <a href="https://www.thewindwardschool.org/the-windward-institute/details/~board/beacon-archives/post/dr-george-church-founding-father-of-genomics">another interview</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I would “read the pictures” growing up, and I gravitated towards STEM subjects that required less reading. [As an undergrad and grad student] I invented work-around skills. Because I would read very slowly, I would just read all the textbooks before the course started. I would just read them very slowly, but then I’d be done. The other thing I would do is just listen in class. Other students wouldn’t listen, so they had to read, but I could listen and remember just about everything. Reading is still very slow for me, but I figure it out like a puzzle. I also listen to books on tape, or e-books today.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Note the &ldquo;I would just read all the textbooks&rdquo; part. As someone who&rsquo;s spent time reading math &amp; science textbooks on their own (caveat being that I am also not nearly as smart as George Church), I can tell you that even for very smart people, this requires a lot of focus and time!</p>
<h3 id="lee-hood">Lee Hood</h3>
<p>Leroy Hood is another biology methods pioneer who played a big role in the early development of DNA sequencing and synthesis and is often credited for inventing the term &ldquo;systems biology&rdquo;. Similar to Church, Hood has also played a role in founding numerous companies. The (highly recommended) <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Hood-Trailblazer-Genomics-Luke-Timmerman-ebook/dp/B01JWTBK30">biography</a> of Hood provides ample evidence for, Hood being another member of the energetic alien club.</p>
<p>Discussing Hood&rsquo;s study habits, the biography shares the following anecdote about how Hood would buckle down during finals:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Hood was gifted with unusual powers of concentration and stamina. During final exams, he would go through the cafeteria in the morning, load up on sandwiches that he could take to the library, and disappear. Having a daylong food supply at his desk kept his energy up without wasting time on formal meals. “He worked much harder than I did,” Adelberger said. “I started eventually adopting some of his practices. It did wonders for my GPA.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This impressive work ethic persisted throughout his scientific career:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>He kept eighteen-hour workdays. Viewing physical endurance as one more way to gain a competitive edge over other scientists, he ran a few miles and did one hundred push-ups every morning before class and lab work.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Hood’s work habits started to become the stuff of legend as the lab scaled up. He’d often do his scientific reading until 11:00 p.m. or midnight, then sleep four to six hours. If he flew to, say, Tokyo to give a talk and arrived home at 2:00 a.m., he’d sometimes go straight to the lab, showing hardly a trace of jet lag, eager to find out what happened while he was gone, former students say.
At first glance, unlike Church, Hood seems to be able to perform well while getting much less sleep than the average person.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Hood&rsquo;s example also shows that being an energetic alien is not necessarily tied to broader neurodivergence. While I don&rsquo;t want to psycho-analyze Hood, my impression from reading the biography is that, besides his tremendous energy, he&rsquo;s relatively normal. This comes through a bit in this quote from Hood&rsquo;s thesis advisor about Hood&rsquo;s style:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>He&rsquo;s superb as a scientist, and he&rsquo;s superb as an administrator and fundraiser, but he wasn&rsquo;t a risk-taker or an imaginative innovator or whatever.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="theory-math--computer-science">Theory (Math &amp; Computer Science)</h2>
<p>While I hope the examples I gave of biologists already debunk the notion that energy only matters in business or physical disciplines, I also want to show that energetic aliens also exist in even more abstract domains.</p>
<h3 id="grothendieck">Grothendieck</h3>
<p>Alexander Grothendieck, who I also discussed in my <a href="https://stephenmalina.com/post/2021-01-23-book-review-the-art-of-learning/">review of The Art of Learning</a>, was one of the most productive, generative, and eccentric mathematicians of the 20th century. Grothendieck was also an energetic alien. According to multiple sources, he went through a ten-year period during which he invented (I suspect he would say discovered) algebraic geometry while spending 10-12 hours a day doing math at a blackboard. Quoting from <a href="https://www.thebigquestions.com/2014/11/17/the-generalist/">this article</a> remembering Grothendieck:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>By letter and in conversations, Serre later confirmed this view. Considering that, as a colleague put it, Grothendieck had done mathematics twelve hours a day, seven days a week, and twelve months a year for twenty years, one can only agree.
<label for="sidenote-5501b6400a1e5ee9c7ed976304f4107c-1" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label>
<input type="checkbox" id="sidenote-5501b6400a1e5ee9c7ed976304f4107c-1" class="margin-toggle"/>
<span class="sidenote"> Ironically, this quote is discussing Grothendieck&rsquo;s work ethic in the context of his eventual burnout. </span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>To some, Grothendieck&rsquo;s workload may seem light in comparison to Church&rsquo;s and Hood&rsquo;s 80-100 hour works. However, anyone who&rsquo;s taken a pure math class knows that thinking about these ideas is difficult in a way that&rsquo;s incomparable to most other cognitive activities.</p>
<p>Grothendieck seems to have been non-neurotypical even amongst mathematicians, although how / whether this connects to his stamina isn&rsquo;t clear to me. Discussing his own mathematical style, Grothendieck wrote:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I can illustrate the second approach with the same image of a nut to be opened.</p>
<p>The first analogy that came to my mind is of immersing the nut in some softening liquid, and why not simply water? From time to time you rub so the liquid penetrates better,and otherwise you let time pass. The shell becomes more flexible through weeks and months – when the time is ripe, hand pressure is enough, the shell opens like a perfectly ripened avocado</p>
<p>A different image came to me a few weeks ago.</p>
<p>The unknown thing to be known appeared to me as some stretch of earth or hard marl, resisting penetration… the sea advances insensibly in silence, nothing seems to happen, nothing moves, the water is so far off you hardly hear it.. yet it finally surrounds the resistant substance.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This led him to conclude that his strengths differed greatly from his peers&rsquo;, writing:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Since then I’ve had the chance in the world of mathematics that bid me welcome, to meet quite a number of people, both among my “elders” and among young people in my general age group who were more brilliant, much more ‘gifted’ than I was. I admired the facility with which they picked up, as if at play, new ideas, juggling them as if familiar with them from the cradle–while for myself I felt clumsy, even oafish, wandering painfully up an arduous track, like a dumb ox faced with an amorphous mountain of things I had to learn (so I was assured) things I felt incapable of understanding the essentials or following through to the end. Indeed, there was little about me that identified the kind of bright student who wins at prestigious competitions or assimilates almost by sleight of hand, the most forbidding subjects.</p>
<p>In fact, most of these comrades who I gauged to be more brilliant than I have gone on to become distinguished mathematicians. Still from the perspective or thirty or thirty five years, I can state that their imprint upon the mathematics of our time has not been very profound. They’ve done all things, often beautiful things in a context that was already set out before them, which they had no inclination to disturb. Without being aware of it, they’ve remained prisoners of those invisible and despotic circles which delimit the universe of a certain milieu in a given era. To have broken these bounds they would have to rediscover in themselves that capability which was their birthright, as it was mine: The capacity to be alone.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As I said above, it&rsquo;s not clear the degree to which Grothendieck&rsquo;s overall strangeness contributed to his ability to work more than others. On one hand, it&rsquo;s tempting to see a relationship between his unique style and his stamina. On the other hand &ndash; as Gwern said to me when I raised this to him &ndash; then why don&rsquo;t all the other Grothendieck-style mathematicians work this much. And as we&rsquo;ll see with the next example of Bourgain, there exist energetic alien mathematicians who have a polar opposite style to Grothendieck.</p>
<p>If anything, Grothendieck&rsquo;s obsessiveness seems most likely to be connected to his stamina. Perhaps the experience of math was so engrossing for Grothendieck &ndash; like an especially fun video game &ndash; that doing it for that many hours a day felt like a gift rather than a burden.</p>
<p>Finally, it is important to note that Grothendieck eventually went kind of crazy, moving to the woods and writing 10s of thousands of pages containing a mix of religious and spiritual ramblings. Again, I want to avoid psycho-analyzing, but it&rsquo;s important to be aware of when looking at the factors that enabled his productivity.</p>
<h3 id="bourgain">Bourgain</h3>
<p>The late Jean Bourgain was one of the most productive mathematicians of the 21st century. Quoting Nature&rsquo; eulogy for him:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Over the course of a wildly prolific career, Belgian mathematician Jean Bourgain would repeatedly enter some area, solve several of its outstanding problems and create an entirely new field of study in the process. His stomping ground was analysis — a discipline that uses estimates to capture the essence of messy mathematical quantities. But, unlike many mathematicians, he turned the powers of his discipline outward, using the lens of analysis to bring far-flung areas such as number theory and computer science into focus.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Bourgain provides a good foil to Grothendieck, providing further evidence against the hypothesis that Grothendieck&rsquo;s rising sea style played the key causal role in his productivity. As opposed to Grothendieck, the ultimate theory-builder, Bourgain was a consummate problem solver, able to find ingenious solutions to incredibly hard problems. In Grothendieck&rsquo;s terms, Bourgain was really good with a chisel.</p>
<p>In spite of this, Bourgain shared Grothendieck&rsquo;s alien work ethic:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Bourgain lived and breathed mathematics. A night owl who travelled frequently back and forth between the IAS and California, where his wife and son lived, he would often, when at Princeton, show up at the IAS shortly before afternoon tea and work with collaborators until well past midnight. Then, after the others had gone to bed, he would continue into the night. His collaborators would often wake up to an e-mail from Bourgain sent at 4 a.m., containing the solution to a problem that, the night before, had seemed as if it would take weeks to crack.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="don-knuth">Don Knuth</h3>
<p>Don Knuth is a famous computer scientist, probably best known as the author of The Art of Computer Programming (TAOCP), an ongoing series of books. What&rsquo;s less known is how much other stuff Knuth did during his career. Before writing TAOCP, Knuth invented TeX, invented many important algorithms including the Knuth-Morris-Pratt string matching algorithms, wrote a discrete math textbook called <strong>Concrete Mathematics</strong>, wrote one of the only mathematical fiction books that involves proving theorems, and invented Literate Programming.</p>
<p>As Knuth puts it, he was able to do all this because he was &ldquo;kind of a machine&rdquo;. While Knuth doesn&rsquo;t outright say how many hours he works, various anecdotes make it clear that he has seemingly always had an exceptional ability to do hard cognitive work continuously for long stretches.</p>
<p>As a demonstration of his persistence and presumably enabled by high cognitive stamina, in college, determined not to be one of the students who failed out at Case Western, Knuth would do all the problems in his calculus textbook:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>But Thomas’s Calculus would have the text, then would have problems, and our teacher would assign, say, the even numbered problems, or something like that. I would also do the odd numbered problems. In the back of Thomas’s book he had supplementary problems, the teacher didn’t assign the supplementary problems; I worked the supplementary problems. I was, you know, I was scared I wouldn’t learn calculus, so I worked hard on it, and it turned out that of course it took me longer to solve all these problems than the kids who were only working on what was assigned, at first. But after a year, I could do all of those problems in the same time as my classmates were doing the assigned problems, and after that I could just coast in mathematics, because I’d learned how to solve problems. So it was good that I was scared, in a way that I, you know, that made me start strong, and then I could coast afterwards, rather than always climbing and being on a lower part of the learning curve.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Later in his career, Knuth, seemingly unable to say no to anything, found himself working around the clock (<a href="https://github.com/kragen/knuth-interview-2006">source</a>):</p>

<p>And I&rsquo;m editing journals. I was editor of 12 technical journals at the time. I was getting papers to referee, and, you know, I was taking that job conscientiously. The way I was operating, when I was at Caltech would be, you know, well, okay, the kids, if, I&rsquo;d take care of the kids, you know, change the diapers, and so on, then they go to bed, if they wake up and cry, I put in my ear plugs, this is my time to do my &ldquo;Art of Computer programming&rdquo; writing. I watch TV, old movies on television, while I&rsquo;m writing chapters for the &ldquo;Art of Computer programming&rdquo;. I get to school, do my editorial work, send out papers to be reviewed, write to the authors of papers. Every morning, I would figure out, what am I going to accomplish this day? And I&rsquo;d stay up until I finished it. You know, I was used to all-nighters from high school, well I started to, you know, to work every day until I had finished what I had set myself to do that day.)</p>

<p>As with the other examples, Knuth seems to have been able to do very difficult cognitive work for many hours while chronically sleep deprived. In fact, he himself says he did some of his best work in this state (<a href="https://amturing.acm.org/pdf/KnuthTuringTranscript.pdf">source</a>):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I’ve always felt after that, hearing many other stories of people of when did they get these special insights that turned out to be important in their research thing, that was very rarely in a settled time of their life, where they had a comfortable living conditions and good – the word is escaping me now - but anyway, luxury; set up a nice office space and good lighting and so forth. No, people are working in a garret, they’re starving, they’ve got kids screaming, there’s a war going on or something. But that’s when they get a lot of their most… almost every breakthrough idea. I’ve always wondered, if you wanted to set up a think tank where you were going to get the most productivity out of your scientists, wouldn’t you have to, not exactly torture them, but deprive them of things? It’s not sustainable. Still, looking back, that was a time when I did as much science as I could, as well as try to fulfill all my other obligations.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We need not only rely on Knuth&rsquo;s own reports. Writing about the history of an early Algol compiler, Richard Waychoff provides us with great additional evidence of Knuth&rsquo;s remarkable productivity. Knuth first appears as a college student who Waychoff hears had promised he could write an Algol compiler in a single Summer on his own. Waychoff reports his own skepticism and belief that Knuth was scamming the people asking for the compiler as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>don claimed that he could write the compiler and a language manual all by himself during his three and a half month summer vacation. He said that he would do it for $5000. Our Fortran compiler required a card reader, card punch. line printer and automatic floating point. Don said that he would not need the card reader or card punch, but he wanted a magnetic tape unit and paper tape. I asked Gerard Guyod how Brad could have been suckered into paying this college kid $5000 to write something that had to be a piece of junk if he was only going to spend three and a half months on it. Gerard whispered his response to me. He said &ldquo;We think that he already has it written. He probably did it in his spare time while working in the computer center at Case Institute.&rdquo; I still wasn&rsquo;t entirely satisfied with that answer because I was a college graduate whose first job was for 5325 per month and I had just changed jobs and was making $525 per month. Besides that it was taking mortal human beings 25 man-years to write compilers: not three and a half man-months. I thought that Brad had taker leave of his senses.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And at points it did seem like Knuth might fail:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It seemed that don was always there, patiently waiting his turn. He knew when we went out to dinner and when we slept. Our compilers were both punched or cards and were the same size. We had written ours in STAR 0, the only assembler that Burroughs supported on the 205. It had been Dick Berman&rsquo;s first programming project. Our compiler took one hour and 45 minutes to assemble. The first week of don&rsquo;s project he spent in writing his own assembler. He could assemble his compiler in 45 minutes. We were green with envy. I am sure that don used only half the computer time that Lloyd and I used.</p>
<p>As the summer wore on don seemed to be losing the total confidence that he had at the beginning of the summer. The pressure was beginning to show. Then something happened that nearly destroyed him. Even though his compiler was going to be distributed on paper tape, he had been working all summer from cards. The time finally came for him to dump the compiler to tope. But it wouldn&rsquo;t fit. I thought that don was going to have a heart attack. It was a classic case of an irresistible force (don&rsquo;s intellect) meeting an immovable object (the size of a reel of paper, tape). As I recall the problem was resolved by Brad allowing him to use two reels of tape.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yet against all odds, Knuth managed to complete the &ldquo;25 man-years&rdquo; of work in the course of the Summer:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Finally the Last day of summer arrived and don had his compiler but not the manual. We were all physically and mentally exhausted. It was Late in the evening when I saw don sitting down at Betty Potter&rsquo;s typewriter to start &lsquo;his manual. I had really grown to like and respect don, but I felt very sorry for him having to get over this last hurdle. So I sat down with him and proofread the pages as they came out of the typewriter. It seemed that he was composing and typing as fast as I could read. By morning the manual was done.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Waychoff also provides us with an additional anecdote about how Knuth&rsquo;s productivity (and brilliance) enabled him to complete his PhD at Caltech while working at Burroughs 40 hours a week:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>He got his Ph.D. n from Cal Tech in a remarkably shot time while working up to forty hours a week at Burroughs (in violation of Cal Tech&rsquo;s policy that limits the number of hours that a Ph.D. candidate can work). It was apparently so easy for him that he hardly seemed aware that he was in college. He was always well rested and never rushed for anything.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In fairness, by Knuth&rsquo;s own account, his ability to graduate so quickly partly resulted from getting lucky by finding a solution to an open problem <label for="sidenote-5501b6400a1e5ee9c7ed976304f4107c-2" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label>
<input type="checkbox" id="sidenote-5501b6400a1e5ee9c7ed976304f4107c-2" class="margin-toggle"/>
<span class="sidenote"> &ldquo;And so I had gotten this list from him, it was in my mail at nine o’clock in the morning, and I remember riding up in the elevator with Professor Olga Todd, who was one of my professors, and I said, Mrs. Todd, I think I’m going to have a theorem in two hours. I’m going to find a way to match these 16 with these 16. And well, I just had a hunch that it was possible, and sure enough, you know, staring at it a little bit, a little bit, I found a connection, and by noon I had a theorem that had solved many, many cases of this open problem about projective planes.<br>
I showed it to Marshall Hall, and he said, well Don, this is your thesis. Write this up and get out of here. You know, you don’t have to wait and do, you know, do this other hard problem, just do this for your thesis. So I felt a little guilty of solving my Ph.D. thesis in two hours and so I had, you know, I spent another few months refining the result and adding on some related theory.&rdquo;<br>
&ndash; <a href="https://github.com/kragen/knuth-interview-2006">From a 2006 interview (transcript) of Knuth</a> </span>
but I still think the fact that he did this while working full-time for Burroughs shows his profound cognitive stamina.</p>
<h3 id="programmers">Programmers</h3>
<p>While programmers already have a reputation for work binges in the zeitgeist, I have a few favorite examples that I couldn&rsquo;t help but include here.</p>
<p>Before jumping in, I want to rebut a (valid) argument made by one of my pre-readers - that the programming examples seemed the weakest because programming seems the most video game-like of the activities described. While it is the case that programming&rsquo;s fast compile-and-test feedback loop does make it easier to focus on than e.g. math, all of the programmers I discuss in the following sections were at least at one point working in areas where they had to solve hard conceptual problems as they went along. Taking John Carmack as a representative example, Carmack is famous not only for his incredible productivity but also for his ability to employ previously research-level ideas in achieving unprecedented rendering feats. <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2019/12/how-much-of-a-genius-level-move-was-using-binary-space-partitioning-in-doom/?comments=1">This article</a> describes one example and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B000FBFNL0/ref=dp-kindle-redirect?_encoding=UTF8&amp;btkr=1">Masters of Doom</a> includes a few others. Circling back, the point I&rsquo;m trying to make with this is that yes, programming may be a little easier to focus on than pure math, but what&rsquo;s impressive about the people I describe is that they combine programming productivity with creativity.</p>
<h3 id="john-carmack">John Carmack</h3>
<p>Founder of Id software and main programmer of of Doom, Quake, Wolfenstein 3D, John Carmack is a legend amongst programmers, both for his skill and his incredible work ethic.
Documented in <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B000FBFNL0/ref=dp-kindle-redirect?_encoding=UTF8&amp;btkr=1">Masters of Doom</a> and confirmed by Carmack himself, he 60 hours a week of work the sweet spot for his happiness and productivity. However, reports from Carmack&rsquo;s colleagues highlight that 13 hours in Carmack&rsquo;s world means 13 hours of serious work. Take, for example, this anecdote from Brian Hook, Carmack&rsquo;s colleague at Id:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I remember Carmack talking about productivity measurement.  While working he would play a CD, and if he was not being productive, he&rsquo;d pause the CD player.  This meant any time someone came into his office to ask him a question or he checked email he&rsquo;d pause the CD player.  He&rsquo;d then measure his output for the day by how many times he played the CD (or something like that &ndash; maybe it was how far he got down into his CD stack).  I distinctly remember him saying &ldquo;So if I get up to go to the bathroom, I pause the player&rdquo;.</p>
<p>You know what&rsquo;s pretty hardcore? Thinking that  <strong>going to the bathroom</strong> is essentially the same as fucking off.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Masters of Doom also includes some great quotes about Carmack&rsquo;s uninterruptible, time-stands-still level of focus:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Carmack was of the moment. His ruling force was focus. Time existed for him not in some promising future or sentimental past but in the present condition, the intricate web of problems and solutions, imagination and code.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Interestingly, Carmack does deviate from other examples in terms of his sleep needs. Contra some hyperbolic reporting about him, he&rsquo;s <a href="https://twitter.com/id_aa_carmack/status/1232668344307810305?lang=en">repeatedly</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/id_aa_carmack/status/932718658366857216?lang=en">mentioned</a> how he requires 8 hours of sleep to function well.</p>
<h3 id="richard-stallman">Richard Stallman</h3>
<p>Richard Stallman is probably best known for founding the GNU project, but also earned permanent programming fame for developing the initial version of the world&rsquo;s most polarizing text editor, emacs. While I couldn&rsquo;t find as much about Stallman&rsquo;s work ethic as some of the other aliens, the one story I did find suggests that he deserves membership in the energetic aliens club.</p>
<p>The following story about Stallman was told by Guy Steele (another famous early programmer) and comes from their time working together in the MIT AI lab. The story describes a pair programming session involving Steele and Stallman and illustrates what I suspect is Stallman&rsquo;s normal level of intensity and focus while programming:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;We sat down one morning,&rdquo; recalls Steele. &ldquo;I was at the keyboard, and he was at my elbow,&rdquo; says Steele. &ldquo;He was perfectly willing to let me type, but he was also telling me what to type.</p>
<p>The programming session lasted 10 hours. Throughout that entire time, Steele says, neither he nor Stallman took a break or made any small talk. By the end of the session, they had managed to hack the pretty print source code to just under 100 lines. &ldquo;My fingers were on the keyboard the whole time,&rdquo; Steele recalls, &ldquo;but it felt like both of our ideas were flowing onto the screen. He told me what to type, and I typed it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The length of the session revealed itself when Steele finally left the AI Lab. Standing outside the building at 545 Tech Square, he was surprised to find himself surrounded by nighttime darkness. As a programmer, Steele was used to marathon coding sessions. Still, something about this session was different. Working with Stallman had forced Steele to block out all external stimuli and focus his entire mental energies on the task at hand. Looking back, Steele says he found the Stallman mind-meld both exhilarating and scary at the same time. &ldquo;My first thought afterward was: it was a great experience, very intense, and that I never wanted to do it again in my life.</p>

<h3 id="max-levchkin">Max Levchkin</h3>
<p>Levchin is now much more famous for his role in founding Paypal and Affirm more recently and also his membership in the Paypal Mafia. However, Max Levchin got his start as a seemingly very productive energetic alien programmer.</p>
<p>Discussing the early days of Paypal in <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B009IXMK4O/ref=dp-kindle-redirect?_encoding=UTF8&amp;btkr=1">Founders at Work</a>, Levchin describes a 5-day coding binge during which he allegedly didn&rsquo;t sleep at all in order to have something working in time for a big investor event:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The product wasn’t really finished, and about a week before the beaming at Buck’s I realized that we weren’t going to be able to do it, because the code wasn’t done. Obviously it was really simple to mock it up—to sort of go, “Beep!  Money is received.” But I was so disgusted with the idea. We have this security company; how could I possibly use a mock-up for something worth $4.5 mil- lion? What if it crashes? What if it shows something? I’ll have to go and commit ritual suicide to avoid any sort of embarrassment. So instead of just getting the mock-up done and getting reasonable rest, my two coders and I coded nonstop for 5 days. I think some people slept; I know I didn’t sleep at all. It was just this insane marathon where we were like, “We have to get this thing working.” It actually wound up working perfectly. The beaming was at 10:00 a.m.; we were done at 9:00 a.m</p>
</blockquote>
<p>While Levchin seems to have <a href="https://www.balancethegrind.com.au/daily-routines/max-levchin-daily-routine/">toned down</a> his work intensity since this time, I think this anecdote suggests an ability to work incredibly hard beyond the point at which an even very high work ethic person would be unable to continue.</p>
<h3 id="greg-brockman">Greg Brockman</h3>
<p>Greg Brockman is currently the founder of OpenAI. Before that, he was an early employee and CTO of Stripe. While Brockman is not famous enough yet to have a ton written about his life &ndash; though if OpenAI creates AGI like they seek to he certainly will be &ndash; a famous screenshot of his weekly RescueTime dashboard suggests that he at least deserves to be an honorary member of the energetic aliens club.</p>
<p><img src="https://miro.medium.com/max/1510/1*YTh5yYfKQxzWthh5yTOJUg.jpeg" alt="Image for post"></p>
<h2 id="writers--artists">Writers &amp; artists</h2>
<p>Of all professions, writers and artists seem to have the strongest reputation for not being able to work more than a certain amount. As a contrarian by temperament, I was delighted to find one counter-example to this claim.</p>
<h3 id="oliver-sacks">Oliver Sacks</h3>
<p>The late Oliver Sacks was a neurosurgeon, writer, and all-around interesting fellow. Best known for his books and columns which explored the relationship between mind and brain, Sacks seems to have possessed a wellspring of physical and mental energy.</p>
<p>Discussing the writing of his first book, Sacks describes how pinning himself to the metaphorical mast led to a 10-day writing binge, during which he experienced a persistent state of euphoria while sleeping very little and writing constantly (<a href="https://www.brainpickings.org/2015/06/19/oliver-sacks-thom-gunn-writing/">source</a>):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I was dissatisfied with my 1967 manuscript and decided to rewrite the book. It was the first of September, and I said to myself, “If I do not have the finished manuscript in Faber’s hands by September 10, I shall have to kill myself.” And under this threat, I started writing. Within a day or so, the feeling of threat had disappeared, and the joy of writing took over. I was no longer using drugs, but it was a time of extraordinary elation and energy. It seemed to me almost as though the book were being dictated, everything organizing itself swiftly and automatically. I would sleep for just a couple of hours a night. And a day ahead of schedule, on September 9, I took the book to Faber &amp; Faber. Their offices were in Great Russell Street, near the British Museum, and after dropping off the manuscript, I walked over to the museum. Looking at artifacts there — pottery, sculptures, tools, and especially books and manuscripts, which had long outlived their creators — I had the feeling that I, too, had produced something. Something modest, perhaps, but with a reality and existence of its own, something that might live on after I was gone.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I unfortunately don&rsquo;t know whether Sacks experienced other periods of similar high productivity throughout his career, but even taken on its own, this example defies the typical dogma about writing only being doable for a few hours a day.</p>
<p>And while this post focuses on cognitive stamina, Sacks provides an interesting example of someone who also possessed high physical energy as well. After getting into weightlifting while living in LA, Sacks focused his efforts on the squat in particular. Similar to his approach to writing, Sacks quickly went from interested in to obsessed with weightlifting. Describing the time, he says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I felt inspired by Karl and determined to lift greater pound-ages myself, to work on the one lift I was already fairly good at—the squat. Training intensively, even obsessively, at a small gym in San Rafael, I worked up to doing five sets of five reps with 555 pounds every fifth day. The symmetry of this pleased me but caused amusement at the gym—“Sacks and his fives.” I didn’t realize how exceptional this was until another lifter encouraged me to have a go at the California squat record. I did so, diffidently, and to my delight was able to set a new record, a squat with a 600-pound bar on my shoulders. This was to serve as my introduction to the power-lifting world; a weight-lifting record is equivalent, in these circles, to publishing a scientific paper or a book in academia.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Although in a very different domain in writing, this story suggests that Sacks&rsquo; obsessive approach and boundless energy extended beyond writing in particular.</p>
<h2 id="politicians">Politicians</h2>
<p>Unsurprisingly, politicians need to have a lot of energy in order to meet with underlings, rally supporters, debate, etc. Since this post is more focused on outliers in heavy cognitive domains and also because I&rsquo;m not very interested in politics, I mostly ignored examples from it. However, I can&rsquo;t help but include one historical example of an energetic aliens who shaped world history.</p>
<h3 id="napoleon">Napoleon</h3>
<p>My knowledge of Napoleon is almost entirely based on <a href="https://dormin.org/2020/01/23/everything-you-need-to-know-about-napoleon-bonaparte/">Dormin&rsquo;s amazing summary</a> of his life, so my quote highlighting Napoleon&rsquo;s boundless energy comes from there as well. Writing about Napoleon&rsquo;s achievements, Dormin says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Even more than speed, Napoleon was remarkable for his <strong>energy</strong>. A man does not fight 43 battles in 19 years by sitting on his ass. It’s almost hard to wrap your head around how much this guy did. He wasn’t just a prolific general, or politician, or emperor, or diplomat, or lawgiver, or aesthetician, he was all of these things <strong>at the same time</strong>. Napoleon basically spent 20 years flinging himself around every inch of Europe micromanaging things, including military conquests, government formations, diplomatic negotiations, the economy, universities, the media, theater, and once he weighed in a Parisian murder investigation. He did this by supposedly sleeping four hours per night (in his prime) and verbally dictating dozens to hundreds of letters per day (rapidly burning through personal secretaries in the process).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>What strikes me about this is not just that Napoleon had high energy, but that, unlike many modern politicians, his achievements extended beyond the purely political. As Dormin beautifully captures, Napoleon was simultaneously an accomplished general, politician, lawmaker, and art critic.</p>
<h2 id="business">Business</h2>
<p>Similar to politics, I feel the importance of cognitive stamina in business is well-described at this point, so I am wary of spending too much time on it. However, I will just throw out the names of a few clear examples of energetic aliens so that I can use them in the discussion:</p>
<ul>
<li>Elon Musk</li>
<li>Marissa Mayer</li>
<li>Jeff Bezos</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="discussion--conclusion">Discussion &amp; Conclusion</h1>
<p>I enjoyed compiling the above examples, but they arguably raise more questions than they answer. In spite of that, hopefully they&rsquo;ve convinced you that there&rsquo;s a <em>there</em> there with respect to the energetic aliens concept and made you curious about what&rsquo;s going on with it. In the next post, we&rsquo;ll try and dissect these examples in the hope of gaining some insight into the underlying phenomenon.</p>
