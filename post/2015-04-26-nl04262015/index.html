<p><a href="https://medium.com/war-is-boring/sebastian-junger-knows-why-young-men-go-to-war-f163804cbf6">Sebastian Junger Knows Why Young Men Go To War</a><br>
Interviews Sebastian Junger, the director of <em>Restrepo</em>, <em>Korengal</em>, and <em>The Last Patrol</em>, all of which follow American soldiers.  There&rsquo;s a lot of good stuff within this relatively short interview - intelligent discussion of masculinity in modern society, the power of choice, and the evolutionary roots of war.</p>

<p><a href="https://chronicle.com/article/The-Slow-Death-of-the/228991/">The Slow Death of the University</a><br>
A British professor argues that the British university system is on the decline due to increased pressure to conform to modern trends. Frankly, I don&rsquo;t agree with the tone or sentiment of this article, but I think that there is value in reading it. The author&rsquo;s view is common enough that it&rsquo;s important to understand, and he discusses the obstacles generally facing the British higher education system.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/education/archive/2015/04/digital-natives-yet-strangers-to-the-web/390990/">Digital Natives, Yet Strangers to the Web</a><br>
Argues that education administrators are so focused on warning students about the perils of the Internet that they neglect to teach them about its &ldquo;intricacies and dynamics,&rdquo; preventing them from learning how to use it responsibly. I really enjoyed this article as I&rsquo;m receptive to almost any argument that replaces a Luddite approach with a forward thinking but nuanced one. Add to that my belief that the Internet is potentially the most powerful tool our society&rsquo;s ever produced and you can see why I enjoyed this article so much.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2015/04/the-myth-of-police-reform/390057/">The Myth of Police Form</a> (Emily Feng)<br>
Questions the notion that police reform can solve social problems. A quote from the article summarizes its themes well:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Police officers fight crime. Police officers are neither case-workers, nor teachers, nor mental-health professionals, nor drug counselors. One of the great hallmarks of the past forty years of American domestic policy is a broad disinterest in that difference. The problem of restoring police authority is not really a problem of police authority, but a problem of democratic authority.&rdquo;</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/19/world/middleeast/sale-of-us-arms-fuels-the-wars-of-arab-states.html?ref=middleeast&amp;_r=1&amp;gwh=6E987FA92D64554C9A2195B5B415225E&amp;gwt=pay&amp;assetType=nyt_now">Sale of U.S. Arms Fuels the Wars of Arab States</a> (Emily Feng)<br>
This article goes well with the article included last week about US involvement in the Middle East (<a href="http://www.cato.org/publications/commentary/us-military-should-stay-home-america-not-iran-biggest-threat-mideast">U.S. Military Should Stay Home: America, Not Iran, Is Biggest Threat to Mideast Stability</a>) The submitter of this article described these two articles well:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;The impression I get after reading both articles is a bit Daoist in flavor; through inaction we create positive results. Conversely, proactive engagement sometimes messes things up further by creating unintended consequences downstream&hellip;most famous example being the mujahideen of Afghanistan re: the Taliban.&rdquo;</p></blockquote>
<p>Also, as an aside, I recently read Ursula K. Le Guin&rsquo;s translation of the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1570623953/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=1570623953&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=stepmali-20&amp;linkId=DLVU4VUNITFAM4C7">Tao Te Ching</a> and enjoyed it quite a bit. Lao Tzu, the author, seems like he was the chief contrarian of his time &ndash; a label that I respect. It&rsquo;s also fun to read, because Le Guin does a good job of adding (or emphasizing depending on your point of view on the original text) an element of humor and play to the work.</p>
<p><a href="http://mobile.nytimes.com/2015/04/12/opinion/sunday/david-brooks-the-moral-bucket-list.html">The Moral Bucket List</a> (Kevin Francfort)<br>
David Brooks, Dartmouth&rsquo;s upcoming commencement speaker, discusses the idea that certain people radiate an &ldquo;inner light&rdquo; that reflects their morality. The first time I read this article, I dismissed it as cheesy. However, the second time I read it, I liked it more. I still think it&rsquo;s pretty cheesy, but I also latched onto the idea that cultivating morality can be thought of as a skill rather than a inherent quality of someone&rsquo;s character. My recent reading of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0307594963/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0307594963&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=stepmali-20&amp;linkId=E4Y4T6UHNJ3CMCAU">Natural Born Heroes</a> by Christopher McDougall, the author of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0028MBKVG/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B0028MBKVG&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=stepmali-20&amp;linkId=QQRG2DSP7Q2W4CJG">Born to Run</a>, reinforces this view in my mind.</p>
