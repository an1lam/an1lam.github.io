Natural Born Heroes
Sometimes, when I read an article, I think it would be great for the
newsletter because it calls into question a widely-held belief or
delves deep into an esoteric topic in a profound way. This isn&rsquo;t one
of those articles &ndash; this is an article that you read and think
&ldquo;this is awesome.&rdquo; The article covers a few different groups reviving or
creating new uses of the human form. ">

Sometimes, when I read an article, I think it would be great for the
newsletter because it calls into question a widely-held belief or
delves deep into an esoteric topic in a profound way. This isn&rsquo;t one
of those articles &ndash; this is an article that you read and think
&ldquo;this is awesome.&rdquo; The article covers a few different groups reviving or
creating new uses of the human form.</p>
<p><a href="http://aeon.co/magazine/psychology/are-we-all-born-with-synaesthesia/">A circus of the senses</a><br>
Surveys scientific studies on synaesthesia. Argues that
synaesthetic abilities exist on a spectrum rather than as a binary.</p>

<p><a href="http://modernfarmer.com/2014/08/brilliant-unusual-twenty-something-hopes-unleash-next-green-revolution/">This Twenty-Something Hopes to Unleash the Next Green Revolution</a><br>
Profiles John Kempf, a mid-twenties Amish farmer, Kempf, who favors a results-based
approach to agriculture which synthesizes modern
and traditional farming techniques. This article stood out to me because
Kempf&rsquo;s techniques don&rsquo;t require farmers to abandon GMOs or
reduce their yields. Kempf, instead, forgoes the rhetoric of the organic
farming movement in exchange for a more pragmatic approach. This quote
exemplifies why Kempf deserves the praise he&rsquo;s receiving:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“I was taken seriously,” Kempf says, “because I was able to ask
really intelligent questions and I didn’t tell anyone how old I
was.”</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="http://www.newyorker.com/business/currency/small-bountiful-small-business-craft-beer">Small is Bountiful</a><br>
Argues that small businesses can exploit large corporations&rsquo; blind spots
in order to find their niche. Paints an optimistic picture of our
economy as a dynamic entity. This article contrasts
<a href="http://www.gallup.com/businessjournal/180431/american-entrepreneurship-dead-alive.aspx">last week&rsquo;s article</a>,
which convincingly argued that entrepreneurship (as opposed to
innovation) is on the decline in the United States. Unfortunately,
last week&rsquo;s article makes a more compelling case, utilizing a more
rigorous statistical approach. That being said, this article
shows how, in certain sectors, small businesses&rsquo; are growing and
thriving.</p>
<p><a href="http://freakonomics.com/2013/07/11/a-burger-a-day-a-new-marketplace-podcast/">Debate: McDouble, Cheap and Nutritious?</a><br>
Summarizes a debate over whether McDonald&rsquo;s McDouble is a good low-cost food
option.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.wired.com/2015/01/diy-cellular-phone-networks-mexico/">Where Cellular Networks Don&rsquo;t Exist, People Are Building Their Own</a><br>
Profiles Rhizomatica&rsquo;s work to bring cellular networks to rural villages
in Mexico. I view this project as a prime example of an effective aid
program.</p>
<p><a href="http://aeon.co/magazine/technology/will-online-anonymity-win-out/">Will online anonymity win out?</a><br>
Questions whether internet activists will win their fight for total
online anonymity. Proposes that online anonymity should be preserved in
most cases. Although I take a harder stance on the rights of internet
users than this author, I thought he did a good job of conveying both
sides of the argument and discussing their relative merits.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/01/26/berlin-story">The Gay Capital of the Nineteenth Century</a><br>
Reviews the gay rights movement that began in late 1800s Berlin. I
enjoyed this piece because it covers German history without falling
victim to the trap of portraying everything before Nazism as
connected to its rise.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.nybooks.com/articles/archives/2015/feb/05/how-isis-rules/">How Isis Rules</a><br>
Provides an inside look at life under the rule of ISIS. This is the most
comprehensive article on ISIS I&rsquo;ve found so far.</p>

Displays panorama images that contain camouflaged snipers. The challenge
is to spot the sniper in the image. While I mostly included this because
I think it&rsquo;s fun, I also enjoyed the comparison made
between these images and Apple advertisements.</p>
