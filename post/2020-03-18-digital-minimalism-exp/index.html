<section><h2 id="intro--motivation">Intro / Motivation</h2>
<p>I know I&rsquo;m a walking millenial trope, but I&rsquo;m starting a deliberate experiment to dramatically reduce my internet engagement. Especially while I&rsquo;m quarantined for who knows how long, I want to almost entirely stop:</p>
<ul>
<li>checking Twitter;</li>
<li>reading about the virus <strong>throughout the day</strong>;</li>
<li>checking email;</li>
<li>reading blogs frequently; and</li>
<li>constantly texting with people (mostly about the virus).</li>
</ul>
<p>Instead, I want to focus on:</p>
<ul>
<li>doing lots of (ML) research;</li>
<li>schoolwork;</li>
<li>spending time outside;</li>
<li>exercising;</li>
<li>video calls with friends;</li>
<li>reading books; and</li>
<li>writing more blog posts.</li>
</ul>
<p>This is largely inspired by Cal Newport&rsquo;s writing, in particular <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07DBRBP7G/ref=dp-kindle-redirect?_encoding=UTF8&amp;btkr=1"><em>Digital Minimalism</em></a>. As he discusses, I hope limiting my mindless browsing and procrastination options will force me to spend more time thinking and even being bored. While I expect I&rsquo;ll also be more productive, I&rsquo;m explicitly not setting increased productivity as a goal since I want to give myself freedom to avoid my usual procrastination sources without feeling like I&rsquo;m forcing myself to just work all the time.</p>
<h2 id="strategy">Strategy</h2>
<p>My overall strategy is going to be a combination of app-enforced blocks and accountability measures for tools that I need more flexible access to.</p>
<h3 id="app-enforced-blocks">App-enforced Blocks</h3>
<p>In order to accomplish these goals without totally shutting myself off from information about the virus and my favorite news sources/blogs/science Twitter, I&rsquo;m going to apply the follow.</p>
<ol>
<li>Use StayFocused to limit access to the browser and email on my phone except during 30 minute windows on Saturday and Sunday respectively.</li>
<li>Use StayFocused to set a daily 45 minute limit on access to messaging apps on my phone (Messages, WhatsApp, Messenger, etc.).</li>
<li>Use LeechBlock to only allow me to access blogs / social media / etc. for an hour a week spread through 1 hour evening time windows each day.</li>
<li>Use LeechBlock to limit access to web-based messaging equivalents to 45 minutes per day.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="accountability-measures">Accountability Measures</h3>
<p>The above blocks don&rsquo;t cover email on my computer and leave me free to multi-task by texting while working without hitting my limit.</p>
<h4 id="email">Email</h4>
<p>Email is hard for me to limit because I rely on it heavily for research and therefore often spend more than 30 minutes composing long progress report emails. It&rsquo;s arbitrary but I consider twice a day a reasonable maximum number of email checks that will allow me to deal with research and any other important school/career stuff I need to but won&rsquo;t allow for email multi-tasking.</p>
<h4 id="texting">Texting</h4>
<p>Texting is also hard because I use it as a valuable way to stay in touch with my girlfriend / friends, which matters to me given our current level of social isolation. However, I want to avoid texting while working but know that my 45 minute time limit won&rsquo;t prevent this on its own.</p>
<h4 id="rescuetime">RescueTime</h4>
<p>To deal with both these and other examples that I probably haven&rsquo;t thought of without giving me free reign to procrastinate in new ways, I&rsquo;ve installed RescueTime on my computer and (will install it once I&rsquo;m no longer blocked from the Play Store) on my phone. Each day, I&rsquo;ll post screenshots of my dashboard under the &lsquo;Tracking&rsquo; section of this post. I expect that knowing that whatever I do will be posted here for all my (hypothetical) readers to see will guilt me into acting in line with the spirit of this experiment even though I have potentially no readers.</p>
<h4 id="daily-plans">Daily Plans</h4>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been casually writing <a href="https://www.calnewport.com/blog/2013/12/21/deep-habits-the-importance-of-planning-every-minute-of-your-work-day/">Cal Newport-style daily plans</a> for a few months and intend to continue doing so as part of this experiment. In line with my comment about productivity above, I&rsquo;m intentionally not going to try to meaningfully my overall work hours because I worry doing so would cause my subconscious to revolt by reverting my typical procrastination activities.</p>
<h3 id="other-digital-activities">Other Digital Activities</h3>
<h4 id="podcasts">Podcasts</h4>
<p>I rarely listen to podcasts in the first place but have been occasionally listening to them while working out. I&rsquo;m giving myself the option to keep doing this as it feels different from the other forms of procrastination I described above and helps me stay motivated to exercise.</p>
<h4 id="tv--movies">TV / Movies</h4>
<p>TV / movies are tougher because I can binge both but both help me relax in small doses. As a compromise, I&rsquo;m going to allow myself 1 hour a day of TV screen time with the option to &lsquo;save up&rsquo; credits during the week for movies. That means if I don&rsquo;t watch any TV one day, I can use the hour from that day to watch a movie later in the week.</p>
<h4 id="video-games">Video Games</h4>
<p>I haven&rsquo;t played video games in a long time and will continue not playing them.</p>
<h3 id="substitute-activities">Substitute Activities</h3>
<p>Another thing Cal Newport often harps on is the importance of finding substitute activities to replace mindless internet / app use. In that vein, I want to have trigger-action plans for the different urges that generally drive me to switch to mindless browsing. I intend to keep updating this list as I notice new things throughout the experiment.</p>
<h4 id="when-i-want-to-browse-blogs--mindlessly-read-in-general">When I want to browse blogs / mindlessly read in general</h4>
<p>I can instead:</p>
<ul>
<li>read a book;</li>
<li>take a short walk;</li>
<li>do Anki cards;</li>
<li>think about research;</li>
<li>think about random questions; or</li>
<li>mess around on <a href="roamresearch.com">Roam</a>.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="when-i-specifically-get-tired-of-working">When I specifically get tired of working</h4>
<p>Instead of tab switching to a procrastination website or email, I can:</p>
<ul>
<li>take a short walk;</li>
<li>read a book;</li>
<li>play a game of pool.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="when-i-want-to-specifically-read-about-the-virus">When I want to specifically read about the virus</h4>
<p>Instead of reading that second, I can:</p>
<ul>
<li>talk to my family about it and hear what they&rsquo;ve been reading; or</li>
<li>write down specific things I want to know and look them up in batch during my chunk of time.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="when-i-crave-social-interaction">When I crave social interaction</h4>
<p>Instead of messaging, I can:</p>
<ul>
<li>schedule a call with a friend;</li>
<li>talk to my family;</li>
<li>play with dogs / cat;</li>
<li>read a book; or</li>
<li>talk to my imaginary friend (just kidding).</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="when-i-want-to-tweet">When I want to tweet</h4>
<p>Instead of doing it that second, I can write it down in Roam and post it later.</p>
<h2 id="tracking">Tracking</h2>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to use this post as a journal in addition to a repository for posting RescueTime screenshots. By recording things I&rsquo;m struggling with on a daily basis or things that work well, I may get some insight into latent factors that drive me to compulsively procrastinate / do mindless browsing.</p>
<h3 id="0320">03/20</h3>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t post yesterday because I considered the post itself my first &lsquo;entry&rsquo; so I&rsquo;ll discuss both days here.</p>
<p>Yesterday went great and today went OK. The main issue today was my sneaking around my webpage block using an incognito tab to click a few virus-related Twitter links my friends sent. I also spent some time watching lifting YouTube videos, which is a grey area for me, since it&rsquo;s sort of procrastinating but also is actually related to something important to me. I&rsquo;m going to see if I can get LeechBlock to block incognito windows and also remember to write things down instead.</p>
<p>I say yesterday &ldquo;went great&rdquo; because I got a lot of work done and felt unusually calm.</p>
<p>Without further ado, my RescueTime data for yesterday and today.</p>
<p><img src="https://stephenmalina.com/images/time-tracking-03-20.png" width="350" height="250" /></p>
<h3 id="0327">03/27</h3>
<p>So obviously I&rsquo;ve been bad about posting daily updates here. I&rsquo;m going to try to get better but no promises since my priority is keeping to the experiment guidelines not posting.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d say the past week has been OK. I just plugged the incognito window loophole that allowed me to access any site in an incognito window, which I hope will help prevent the small amount of cheating I&rsquo;ve been doing. For the next 7 days, I want to <em>really</em> practice writing down things to look up rather than cheating.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve also decided to stop posting RescueTime screenshots. I haven&rsquo;t been impressed by RescueTime&rsquo;s labeling of browser use and already track my work time using <a href="toggl.com">Toggl</a> so RescueTime doesn&rsquo;t provide me much additional value. Given that, it seems silly to use it just for the purpose of posting screenshots.</p>
<h2 id="0416">04/16</h2>
<p>As may be obvious, the first iteration experiment failed. Starting today, I&rsquo;m going to try again. In the mean time, I&rsquo;ve spent some time doing an informal post-mortem to think through what went wrong and came to the following conclusions:</p>
<ul>
<li>I didn&rsquo;t do a good job of writing things down to look up later.</li>
<li>I assumed that having blocks on sites would work perfectly rather than presenting an inconvenience for my wily side.</li>
<li>Allowing myself 30 minutes on both weekend days devolved into weekend days becoming free-for-alls.</li>
</ul>
<p>Given the above, I&rsquo;m changing a few things about the experiment this time around:</p>
<ul>
<li>Make sure to write things down to look up later <em>from the beginning</em>.</li>
<li>Less focus on blocking sites and then trying to improve those blocks when I find a way around them.</li>
<li>No temporary weekend internet browsing sessions during the month-long experiment. This is something I&rsquo;ll instead consider introducing if the first month goes well.</li>
<li>No RescueTime.</li>
</ul>
