<section><p>For the past two years, my friends have had a tradition of making predictions and scoring them at the end of the year. This year, I decided why not just post my predictions on my blog and score them publicly (with a few redacted)? This will hopefully incentivize me to be more thoughtful about them and also will help direct my endless desire for internet acclaim towards something that has a positive side effect.</p>
<p>Each prediction is written in the format, &ldquo;#. <prediction>: &lt;confidence level (%)&gt;.&rdquo; Similar to my friend Eric, <a href="https://ericneyman.wordpress.com/2020/12/31/predictions-for-2021/">whose predictions</a> I also recommend checking out, I&rsquo;ll be scoring my predictions using $ \log $ scores. Also similar to Eric, I&rsquo;m happy to score other people&rsquo;s performance on my predictions. To participate in this, follow the instructions Eric gave on his blog (modified with my own deadline and email):</p>
<blockquote cite="">
<p>I’d also like to advertise a challenge for my readers. You can <a href="https://stephenmalina.com/about/">email me</a> with your predictions for a subset of my predictions with your own prediction. I’ll judge your predictions against mine using the logarithmic scoring rule. I have the advantage of having chosen the questions, but you have the advantage of having seen my predictions. In theory this gives you the upper hand: for example, you could put down my probabilities for every event except a few where you think I clearly messed up. Consider this an exercise in second-order knowledge: figuring out how much weight to put on my probabilities despite not knowing my reasoning behind them. Your score will be the sum, over all questions you choose, of your log score minus my log score.1 (So you can guarantee yourself a score of 0 by sending me an empty list.)</p>
<p>Please make your predictions by January 17th at 11:59pm ET and send them to me as a text file where each line has the format “Category: [event #], [probability as a decimal]”. I will throw out any predictions that resolve (or nearly resolve) by January 17th.</p>
  <footer></footer>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>I&rsquo;ll be finalizing my own predictions on January 17th</strong> as well, after which I&rsquo;m not allowed to make changes to them. <ins>This means that you have a week to send me suggestions for additional things to make predictions about!</ins> In particular, I&rsquo;m interested in finding good indexes for the rate at which people are moving out of cities like SF and NYC (my initial Googling came up short).</p>
<p>Finally, I want to add an important disclaimer that all predictions are descriptive not prescriptive. Me saying something is probable is entirely independent of how much I want it to happen. In other words, keep your ought out of my is-es. On a more procedural note, all dates should be assumed to refer to 2021 unless otherwise stated. Without further ado, as the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIxeJrPlCNM">eternal great one</a> famously said, &ldquo;thumbs up, let&rsquo;s do this!&rdquo;</p>
