<section><h1 id="philosophy">Philosophy</h1>
<p><a href="http://aeon.co/magazine/society/did-zen-philosophy-create-the-kamikaze/">Did Zen philosophy create the Kamikaze?</a><br>
Pontificates on the relationship between WWII-era Zen philosophers and Japanese Jingoism.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/george-f-will-bettina-stangneth-reveals-adolf-eichmanns-warped-idealism/2014/11/14/33de5bba-6b81-11e4-a31c-77759fc1eacc_story.html">A murderer&rsquo;s warped idealism</a><br>
Contrasts previous portrayals of Adolf Eichmann as &ldquo;terrifyingly normal&rdquo; and &ldquo;banal&rdquo; with stories
of his devotion to &ldquo;the Final Solution.&rdquo;</p>
<h1 id="our-miraculous-biosphere">Our Miraculous Biosphere</h1>
<p><a href="http://nautil.us/issue/8/home/the-termite-and-the-architect">The Termite and the Architect</a><br>
Begins by talking about an architect&rsquo;s attempt to mimic the way termites&rsquo; mounds manage air flow,
and then uses this example as an example of biomimicry. Due to this article, I&rsquo;ve
latched onto the question of what would happen if we could harness the full power of swarms in
our architecture and even our economy?</p>
<p><a href="http://www.bbc.com/earth/story/20141111-plants-have-a-hidden-internet">The Planternet</a><br>
Describes our growing understanding of the &ldquo;wood-wide web,&rdquo; the fungal connections that allow
plants to communicate in previously unforeseen ways. The similarities with the internet presented
are fascinating and potentially instructive for the architects of the next web.</p>
<h1 id="education">Education</h1>
<p><a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/education/archive/2014/11/at-the-air-force-academy-stem-education-isnt-enough/382793/">Why Air Force Cadets study the
humanities</a><br>
Details how the Air Force academy combines a rigorous STEM curriculum with a healthy dose of liberal
arts. As a student at a liberal arts college and a STEM major, this article felt relevant to me.
Beyond that, I thought the Air Force academy&rsquo;s methodology presented a compelling portrait of the
future of liberal arts education. Like it or not, liberal arts colleges seem to be integrating and
expanding traditionally pre-professional disciplines, and this article provided a way to do this
while maintaining a focus on the traditionally espoused benefits of the humanities.</p>
<h1 id="mind-and-brain">Mind and Brain</h1>
<p><a href="http://www.livescience.com/48721-bilingual-brain-bodybuilders.html">Positive Effects of Bilingualism on the
Brain</a><br>
Summarizes recent research on the neurological effects of speaking two languages. I often face a
dilemma when including soft science articles like this one. On one hand, I find the basic thesis of
this article and the study it describes compelling and fascinating. On the other hand, I am acutely
aware of the dangers of blindly trusting &ldquo;fad science,&rdquo; a category in which articles like this often
fall into. My solution to this tension is simply to make you aware of it. So, read the article or
don&rsquo;t. But, if you do, be aware of my reservations.</p>
<h1 id="technology-and-politics">Technology and Politics</h1>
<p><a href="http://www.technologyreview.com/featuredstory/531616/the-right-way-to-fix-the-internet/">On Net Neutrality</a><br>
Carefully breaks down the argument for net neutrality. This issue defies typical party lines and
endlessly confuses me. The article definitely presents a pragmatic
case for opposing net neutrality. The author displays an awareness of how the modern internet works and what
features of it are important to protect.</p>
<h1 id="robotics-and-prosthetics">Robotics and Prosthetics</h1>
<p><a href="http://www.technologyreview.com/news/532431/rise-of-the-robot-security-guards/">Rise of the Robot Security
Guards</a><br>
Presents some of the first robot security vehicles. These bots both present a huge opportunity and a
surveillance nightmare.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2014/11/the-boy-with-the-lego-hand/382637/">The Boy with the Lego Hand</a><br>
Inspires the reader with a story of a boy who managed to work with a professional product designer
to build a new prosthetic hand that fits his needs.</p>
<h1 id="productivity">Productivity</h1>
<p><a href="https://medium.com/matter/work-it-harder-make-it-better-do-it-faster-makes-us-stronger-65c137c79aeb">Workplace Productivity Experiment</a><br>
A New York Magazine writer details his attempts to increase his day-to-day workplace productivity.
The blend of useful information presented and playfulness make this article worthwhile.</p>
<h1 id="other-contributions">Other Contributions</h1>
<p><a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/michelinemaynard/2014/10/21/michigan-to-tesla-motors-youre-not-welcome/">Michigan Blocking Tesla from selling
Cars</a> (Contributed by <strong>Paul</strong>, Described by <strong>Me</strong>)<br>
Discusses Michigan&rsquo;s efforts to block Tesla from selling cars in their stores in Michigan. I have no
tolerance for this sort of politicking but you are free to come to your own conclusions.</p>
