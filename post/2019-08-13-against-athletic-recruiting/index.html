<h1 id="introduction">Introduction</h1>

<p>Given recent discussions of admissions quotas for certain groups at elite universities, I&rsquo;ve been surprised to see little discussion of athlete admissions and athletic recruiting at schools like Harvard. I&rsquo;m especially surprised to see so little discussion of this in my Twitter-sphere, which consists of ~0 former recruited athletes as far as I know. So, in this post, I will make the case for eliminating athletic recruiting at &ldquo;elite&rdquo; universities.</p>

<h1 id="defining-athletic-recruiting">Defining Athletic Recruiting</h1>

<h1 id="outline">Outline</h1>

<h2 id="defining-elite-universities">Defining &ldquo;Elite&rdquo; Universities</h2>

<p>I know that no matter how I define &ldquo;elite&rdquo;, someone&rsquo;s going to be upset, so I&rsquo;m going to rip off the bandaid now. My definition of &ldquo;elite&rdquo; roughly corresponds to the top 20 to 30 schools in the <a href="https://www.usnews.com/best-colleges/rankings/national-universities">US News National University Rankings</a>. And while I know the US News rankings are based on a flawed methodology and that there are many good schools not in the top 20 to 30 ranked schools, for the purposes of this post, using it as a rough guide should work well enough. I&rsquo;m only using the term &ldquo;elite&rdquo; in the first place because I want to focus my discussion primarily on schools for which athletics are secondary to academics in terms of focus and widespread brand.</p>

<h2 id="defining-athletic-recruiting-1">Defining Athletic Recruiting</h2>

<p>When I talk about athletic recruiting, I&rsquo;m referring to the practice followed by Division I schools of admitting athletes through an essentially separate applicant pipeline. While processes vary across Division I schools, all Ivy League schools seem to follow roughly the same process as described <a href="https://ivyleague.com/sports/2017/7/28/information-psa-index.aspx">here</a>, so I&rsquo;ll use their process as a representative example.</p>

<p>Within the Ivy League, schools can&rsquo;t offer the same assurances or incentives to athletes as schools within other Division I conferences. In particular, Ivy League schools only offer need-based financial aid, whereas other Division I schools can offer athletic scholarships. Furthermore, Ivy League schools aren&rsquo;t able to guarantee admission to prospective recruits as early as other Division I schools can&ndash;often in the Spring of candidates&rsquo; junior years of high school. On the other hand, Ivy League schools do have two forms of &ldquo;soft guarantees&rdquo; they can provide to athletes that go beyond the normal admissions process. First, before the normal candidate admissions process even starts, coaches work with admissions offices to get preliminary assessments of candidate profiles and then share these assessments with candidates. From there, coaches can verbally indicate to candidates that they intend to &ldquo;support&rdquo; them in the admissions process, sometimes conditional on candidates expressing a certain level of interest in the school. Second, admissions offices and coaches work together to extend a certain number of likely letters to the most promising athletic recruits (and a smaller number of very desirable non-athletes) months in advance of the normal admissions decision date (as early as October 1st). For an athletic recruit, receiving a likely letter basically means you have a spot at the school (and on the team) barring any dramatic change in your profile, academic or otherwise. I was hoping to find statistics on what % of athletes in the Ivy League receive likely letters and/or verbal expressions of interest from coaches, but unfortunately couldn&rsquo;t find any.</p>

<p>Regarding other schools in the US News Top 30, my sense is that the other Division I schools like Stanford, Berkeley, Northwestern, Duke, etc. have as or even more fleshed out athletic admissions pipelines. On the other hand, neither CalTech nor MIT have any special processes in place for recruiting and admitting athletes, so all subsequent discussion applies to neither of these schools.</p>

<h2 id="arguments-in-favor-of-athletic-recruiting">Arguments in Favor of Athletic Recruiting</h2>

<ul>
<li>Athletics improve brand recognition</li>
<li>Athletics bring in donor $ / donate more</li>
<li>Athletes achieve better than average career outcomes</li>
<li>Athletes enrich the student body through a form of diversity</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="arguments-against-athletic-recruiting">Arguments Against Athletic Recruiting</h2>

<h3 id="moral">Moral</h3>

<ul>
<li>Athletes are worse students

<ul>
<li>From <a href="https://blog.prepscholar.com/how-do-ivy-league-schools-recruit">here</a>:
&gt;</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Athletes are less diverse (maybe&hellip;)

<ul>
<li></li>
</ul></li>

<li><p>Athletes <em>may</em> commit more sexual assaults</p>

<ul>
<li>From <a href="https://www.espn.com/espn/otl/story/_/id/25149259/college-athletes-three-s-more-likely-named-title-ix-sexual-misconduct-complaints">here</a>:
&gt; The data provided show that, on average, about 6.3 percent of Title IX complaints against students &ndash; whether the complaint resulted in a formal investigation or not &ndash; included an athlete as the person accused of wrongdoing, officially called a &ldquo;respondent&rdquo; in the reports. Though that percentage equates to a minority of the overall number of complaints at Power 5 campuses made during the time period, athletes were named in such reports more often than might be expected considering they represent, on average, just 1.7 percent of total student enrollment at the universities.</li>
<li>From <a href="https://www.athleticbusiness.com/rules-regulations/college-athletic-departments-role-in-investigating-sexual-assaults.html?_ga=2.3777712.1467092432.1565746402-1501808809.1565746402">here</a>, although it&rsquo;s worth noting that the first statistic doesn&rsquo;t cite a source.
&gt; While less than four percent of college students are athletes, student-athletes are involved in 19 percent of sexual assaults reported on college campuses.
&gt; The NCAA&rsquo;s actions were prompted by a survey released in July 2014 by the office of U.S. Senator Claire McCaskill that found that 22 percent of colleges surveyed reported that their athletic departments had oversight over sexual assault allegations made against athletes.</li>
<li>From <a href="https://www.jeffbenedict.com/index.php/articles/item/colleges-protect-athletes-not-students">here</a>:
&gt;  A 1994 study of 10 Division I schools with powerhouse football and basketball teams found that while athletes composed just 3 percent of the male student population, they were responsible for 19 percent of the colleges’ sexual assaults and 35 percent of acts of domestic violence.</li>
<li>From <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/1077801296002002004">here</a>, for which I could only get the abstract unfortunately:
&gt;  The findings indicate an over-representation of male student-athletes in reports of violence against women (battering and sexual assault).</li>

<li><p>From <a href="http://www.ncurproceedings.org/ojs/index.php/NCUR2017/article/view/2174">here</a>:
&gt; Of the rape cases reported on college campuses, 25% involved varsity athletes</p>
