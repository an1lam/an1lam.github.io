High-Level Outline
#


Focus on code comprehension rather than code reading. When we focus on code reading, we&rsquo;re
prioritizing an image of what&rsquo;s virtuous over the actual goal &ndash; to understand something enough
to change it or evolve it in a different domain.
For comprehension, active beats passive, goal-directed beats random, and critical beats
unquestioning. No one who cares about comprehension should encourage passive code reading.
How can we design codebases for active, goal-directed, and critical reading? Tests are good for
active fiddling but don&rsquo;t do enough at a high-level to help goal-directed explorers. A
goal-directed explorer cares about finding something similar to what they want to do and
understanding the intent of what&rsquo;s there enough to know what they can throw away.

Introduction: Comprehension as goal.

Seibel should&rsquo;ve asked people what code they learned about or hacked on for fun. What
matters is that they learned about a codebase for it&rsquo;s own sake, not that they read it.
Comprehension comes about from the interplay of active and passive exploration (Cal
Newport&rsquo;s textbook method) - reading code to hack on it or understand how it accomplishes
something specific. Group this under &ldquo;purposeful reading&rdquo;.


Active over passive. Although very few people seem to read code passively, let&rsquo;s beat
into the ground why it&rsquo;s inferior to purposeful reading.

Learning research shows that active exploration beats passive consumption for comprehension
in general (can cite Cal
Newport,
Anders Ericsson, Herbert
Simon, and Barbara
Oakley).
The best learning happens when you&rsquo;re actively interacting with the material
through synthesis and reframing, critically examining its claims, and building fluency
through active repetition .
Let&rsquo;s see how passive code stacks up against hacking-driven exploration for comprehension:

Passive reading is linear but random. It&rsquo;s hard for a passive reader to be critical
because they lack clear measures (beyond local features like &ldquo;clean&rdquo;) with which to
examine the code and all features of the code seem equally important.
Purposeful reading is non-linear but goal-directed. A purposeful reader critically
examines the code and weighs the relative importance of its features in order to decide
whether it does what he or she needs.
Neither involves much repetition but purposeful reading involves more remixing (not
totally sure whether to include this?).
Passive code readers may be aware of a larger area of the codebase, but lack
contextualized knowledge.


Can frame this comparison by comparing a codebase to a map (blurb copy-pasted).

A codebase resembles a map. You can ask an infinite number of questions of a map. How far
is it from A to B? Which is the nearest town to C? It makes no sense to read a map
linearly from top to bottom, left to right. Obviously trying to enumerate all possible
questions is an exercise in futility. ">

</li>
<li>Designing for purposeful reading (and hacking). Not sure of the final answer, but here are some
ideas.
<ol>
<li>Tests are good.</li>
<li>But tests don&rsquo;t give a higher-level view. Especially important for cross-cutting features.
<ol>
<li>Can we write documentation that focuses on mapping edges rather than nodes? Less what
this thing does and more how different ideas flow through the code. De-emphasize local
messiness in exchange for keeping high-level map up-to-date?</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Project-specific katas build fluency through repetition.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Conclusion: Assume future readers will explore purposefully and hack.
<ol>
<li>Trade time spent adding more information for time spent coming up with things a future
programmer can do that will require them understanding the information you would&rsquo;ve written
down.</li>
<li>Prioritize fixing or create high-level maps which emphasize historical intent over cleaning
up local features.</li>
</ol>
