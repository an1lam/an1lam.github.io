<section><h1 id="high-level-outline">High-Level Outline</h1>
<ol>
<li>Focus on code comprehension rather than code reading. When we focus on code reading, we&rsquo;re
prioritizing an image of what&rsquo;s virtuous over the actual goal &ndash; to understand something enough
to change it or evolve it in a different domain.</li>
<li>For comprehension, active beats passive, goal-directed beats random, and critical beats
unquestioning. No one who cares about comprehension should encourage passive code reading.</li>
<li>How can we design codebases for active, goal-directed, and critical reading? Tests are good for
active fiddling but don&rsquo;t do enough at a high-level to help goal-directed explorers. A
goal-directed explorer cares about finding something similar to what they want to do and
understanding the intent of what&rsquo;s there enough to know what they can throw away.</li>
</ol>
<h1 id="detailed-outline">Detailed Outline</h1>
<ol>
<li>Introduction: Comprehension as goal.
<ol>
<li>Seibel should&rsquo;ve asked people what code they learned about or hacked on for fun. What
matters is that they learned about a codebase for it&rsquo;s own sake, not that they read it.</li>
<li>Comprehension comes about from the interplay of active and passive exploration (Cal
Newport&rsquo;s textbook method) - reading code to hack on it or understand how it accomplishes
something specific. Group this under &ldquo;purposeful reading&rdquo;.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Active over passive. Although very few people seem to read code passively, let&rsquo;s beat
into the ground why it&rsquo;s inferior to purposeful reading.
<ol>
<li>Learning research shows that active exploration beats passive consumption for comprehension
in general (can cite <a href="http://calnewport.com/blog/2012/08/10/you-know-what-you-write-the-textbook-method-for-ultra-learning">Cal
Newport</a>,
Anders Ericsson, <a href="http://158.132.155.107/posh97/private/learning/learning-Simon.htm">Herbert
Simon</a>, and <a href="http://nautil.us/issue/40/learning/how-i-rewired-my-brain-to-become-fluent-in-math-rp">Barbara
Oakley</a>).</li>
<li>The best learning happens when you&rsquo;re actively interacting with the material
through synthesis and reframing, critically examining its claims, and building fluency
through active repetition .</li>
<li>Let&rsquo;s see how passive code stacks up against hacking-driven exploration for comprehension:
<ol>
<li>Passive reading is linear but random. It&rsquo;s hard for a passive reader to be critical
because they lack clear measures (beyond local features like &ldquo;clean&rdquo;) with which to
examine the code and all features of the code seem equally important.</li>
<li>Purposeful reading is non-linear but goal-directed. A purposeful reader critically
examines the code and weighs the relative importance of its features in order to decide
whether it does what he or she needs.</li>
<li>Neither involves much repetition but purposeful reading involves more remixing (not
totally sure whether to include this?).</li>
<li>Passive code readers may be aware of a larger area of the codebase, but lack
contextualized knowledge.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Can frame this comparison by comparing a codebase to a map (blurb copy-pasted).
<blockquote>
<p>A codebase resembles a map. You can ask an infinite number of questions of a map. How far
is it from A to B? Which is the nearest town to C? It makes no sense to read a map
linearly from top to bottom, left to right. Obviously trying to enumerate all possible
questions is an exercise in futility.</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Designing for purposeful reading (and hacking). Not sure of the final answer, but here are some
ideas.
<ol>
<li>Tests are good.</li>
<li>But tests don&rsquo;t give a higher-level view. Especially important for cross-cutting features.
<ol>
<li>Can we write documentation that focuses on mapping edges rather than nodes? Less what
this thing does and more how different ideas flow through the code. De-emphasize local
messiness in exchange for keeping high-level map up-to-date?</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Project-specific katas build fluency through repetition.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Conclusion: Assume future readers will explore purposefully and hack.
<ol>
<li>Trade time spent adding more information for time spent coming up with things a future
programmer can do that will require them understanding the information you would&rsquo;ve written
down.</li>
<li>Prioritize fixing or create high-level maps which emphasize historical intent over cleaning
up local features.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
