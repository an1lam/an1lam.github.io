  <section><p>One thing I like about the synthetic biology community is that, from the early days, its participants have been willing to entertain &ldquo;wild&rdquo; ideas like <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-019-02468-w">building dragons</a>. While this willingness comes with all of the risks associated with building a lot of hype around a nascent technology, against the backdrop of cultural indefinite pessimism, I still prefer it. In that vein, inspired by Milan Cwitkovic&rsquo;s legendary listicles on <a href="https://milan.cvitkovic.net/writing/things_youre_allowed_to_do/">Things you&rsquo;re allowed to do</a> and <a href="https://milan.cvitkovic.net/writing/market_failures_in_science/">Market failures in science</a>, I decided to make my own listicle of cool ideas for future synthetic biology &amp; bioengineering projects. If you have additional ideas that you want me add (with credit) don&rsquo;t hesitate to <a href="mailto:stephenmalina@gmail.com">reach out</a>.</p>
<p>These ideas are currently only organized into two categories: my ideas and those I directly stole from others (with credit given to those people), but if the lists get long enough I may go back and add some intermediate categories.</p>
<h1 id="criteria">
Criteria
<a href="#criteria" class="heading-anchor">#</a>
</h1>
<p>The criteria I used when deciding whether to include ideas are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>I believe there are no physical impediments to its eventual development. In other words, it would qualify as a <strong>hard</strong> sci-fi idea.</li>
<li>It seems at least a little useful for someone somewhere under a broad definition of &ldquo;useful&rdquo; which would include dragons.</li>
<li>It&rsquo;s fun. This one was very important.</li>
<li>If it&rsquo;s evil, it&rsquo;s in a mostly harmless way &ndash; like building a dragon &ndash; rather than a full-on supervillain might use this to actually hurt people way. In particular, I was careful not to include any ideas whose spread might increase biorisk. Frankly, I don&rsquo;t think I have any of these anyway but if I did I wouldn&rsquo;t have included them.</li>
</ul>
<p>Non-criteria:</p>
<ul>
<li>Is it a good business? Although, if you want to make a business out of one of these, definitely let me know.</li>
<li>Is there a non-biology-based solution? A common refrain for various synthetic biology ideas is, &ldquo;well couldn&rsquo;t you just do that with X?&rdquo; Where X is often chemistry/electronics/etc. This is a good question for someone trying to start a business but a bad one for someone trying to think of cool shit to do with biology. This article is a cool-shit futurists zone, so while <a href="https://nintil.com/cozy-futurism/">cozy futurism</a> may be a valid alternative perspective, it&rsquo;s not the perspective these ideas are coming from.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>These are ideas that I think I came up with but it&rsquo;s possible I am forgetting that I read them somewhere. If you think this is the case for one of these ideas, please don&rsquo;t hesitate to ping me and I&rsquo;ll update to give credit where it&rsquo;s due.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.dynotx.com/">AAVs for gene therapy</a> that are amazing transducers, non-immunogenic, tissue/cell type targeted, and can package arbitrarily large genomes. (I had to shill Dyno a little bit. Also not my idea originally but I wanted to put it first&hellip;)</li>
<li>Edited microbes that screen for toxins or just undesirable chemicals in my gut like <a href="https://slimemoldtimemold.com/2021/08/02/a-chemical-hunger-part-vii-lithium/">lithium</a>.</li>
<li><strong>In vivo</strong> bio-logs from engineered mammalian cells that use a souped up version of <a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.11.05.467507v1">molecular recording</a> to track health in real time and spit out &ldquo;reports&rdquo; once a day (or on some regular cadence) that can be read via cheap (nanopore?) sequencing.</li>
<li>Biological <a href="https://www.azonano.com/article.aspx?ArticleID=3034">respirocytes</a>, i.e. improved versions of red blood cells.
<ul>
<li>For example, has anyone tried doing directed evolution for oxygen capacity on a red blood cell?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Engineered versions of mammalian cells with all the <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5857283/">retro-transposons</a> removed.</li>
<li>Optically (?) programmable <strong>in vitro</strong> <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41587-020-0695-9">enzymatic DNA synthesis</a> on the cheap.
<ul>
<li>This may actually be impossible&hellip;</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Affordable <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10404-018-2048-2">desktop microfluidics</a> rigs for tinkering with cell programming.</li>
<li>At home <strong>de novo</strong> peptide design setup that comes with a nice structure-based and sequence-based design computational toolkit paired with a <a href="https://arborbiosci.com/synthetic-biology/cell-free-protein-expression/mytxtl/">cell-free</a> (or cell-based) expression chassis that pipes into a generic purification system.</li>
<li>Desktop <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_sequencing">protein sequencer</a>.</li>
<li>Way to grow meat (or <a href="https://thatmre.medium.com/how-i-got-the-idea-for-spira-17be35881cf0">spirulina</a>) from raw materials at (or spirulina) home. Imagine if your garden could grow steaks!</li>
<li>Nasal realtime air purifying microbes. Needs a catchier name than the smellobiome though.</li>
<li>Fast growing, temperature resistant, reasonable sized fruit plants for all my favorite fruits.</li>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Culture#Physiology">Culture-style</a> in vivo consciously controlled stimulant glands. (Ok I know now I&rsquo;m veering off into ridiculously sci-fi ideas.)</li>
<li>Brain-computer interfaces that can be installed non-invasively by &ldquo;brick-layer cells&rdquo; (my term) and dissolved at any time by an opto- or sono-genetic trigger.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="others">
Others'
<a href="#others" class="heading-anchor">#</a>
</h2>
<p><strong>These are ideas that others came up with but fit my criteria and so I want to give credit/signal boost them.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Edited microbes that express vitamins &ndash; such as B12 for vegans/vegetarians &ndash;people are deficient in and live in your gut (<a href="https://arye.substack.com/p/set-biotech-free-">Arye Lipman</a>).</li>
<li>Plants that can be programmed to synthesize different compounds, e.g. medicine (<a href="https://arye.substack.com/p/set-biotech-free-">Arye Lipman</a>).</li>
<li>Desktop rig for printing mRNA therapeutics (<a href="https://twitter.com/RyanBethencourt/status/1427173515279491074">Ryan Bethencourt</a>). It would also be nice if the encapsulating LNPs had tissue-specific settings too&hellip;</li>
<li>Growing houses and other various uses for genetically engineered wood (<a href="https://twitter.com/ProfTomEllis/status/1437528065379377153">entire</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/SynBio1/status/1445767208143966217">#woodgang</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/ATinyGreenCell/status/1448053594381557775">crew</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/ProfTomEllis/status/1422593843912921091">on</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/p_maverick_b/status/1463927749119287298">Twitter</a>).</li>
<li>Reviving extinct megafauna such as <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/09/13/science/colossal-woolly-mammoth-DNA.html">wooly mammoths</a> (<a href="https://reviverestore.org/projects/woolly-mammoth/">George Church, Stewart Brand, et al.</a>).</li>
