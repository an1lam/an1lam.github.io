<p>Effortless Mastery is a strange book, one-third meditation guide, one-third musical exercises, and one-third amateur (seriously amateur) metaphysics sermon. Reading Effortless Mastery reaffirmed my growing conviction that some books just aren&rsquo;t meant to be read all-the-way-through from front to back. As a non-musician, mystical skeptic, and fox-in-training, I have little in common with the author of Effortless Mastery, Kenny Werner. Moreover, I suspect Werner, a professional musician, Advaita Vedanta adherent, hedgehog (by my assessment, I doubt he&rsquo;s aware of the fox-hedgehog dichotomy), wouldn&rsquo;t like me, even if we ignore my brief attack on his only published work.</p>

<p>All that said, Effortless Mastery makes up for all its quirks, fluff, and half-baked metaphysics because it captures an important concept that I&rsquo;ve never been able to grok, &ldquo;that which is worth doing, is worth doing effortlessly.&rdquo; Werner&rsquo;s connection of effortlessness to musical playing and practice resolves a dichotomy that writings on Taoism (I&rsquo;ve read this one, and this one), Flow, and deliberate practice all fumble with, the dichotomy between intentional growth and effortlessness.</p>

<h2 id="the-tension-between-flow-and-mastery">The Tension Between Flow and Mastery</h2>

<p>If you read enough Taoist and psychology books that discuss expertise, you&rsquo;ll eventually notice writers in the space adhere to one of three schools-of-thought about what type of action creates and reinforces mastery: the &ldquo;just go with the flow&rdquo; school, the &ldquo;push, push, push&rdquo; school, and the &ldquo;push until you make it&rdquo; school.</p>

<p>In the &ldquo;go with the flow&rdquo; school, I place Taoists together with Mihaly Csikszentmihaly (one of two recursive names I&rsquo;ve seen), so widely cited at this point that he&rsquo;s earned his own category. Both Taoists and Csikszentmihaly argue that growth occurs as a side effect of the flow state, often called wu-wei in Taoism.</p>
