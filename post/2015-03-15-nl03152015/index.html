<h1 id="genocide">Genocide</h1>

<p><a href="http://blog.longreads.com/2015/03/11/interview-with-a-torturer/">Interview with a Torturer</a><br />
An author and survivor of the Khmer Rouge genocide in Cambodia attempts to come to terms with his experience. At times, this piece was hard to read at times, but I think that quality adds to its power. This quote really resonated with me:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;There’s a contemporary notion that we’re all potential torturers. This fatalism tinged with smugness exercises literature, film, and certain intellectuals. After all what’s more exciting than a great criminal? No, we’re not all a fraction of an inch, the depth of a sheet of paper, from committing a great crime. For my part I believe in facts and I look at the world. The victims are in their place. The torturers too.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>

<h1 id="international-affairs">International Affairs</h1>

<p><a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/features/archive/2015/03/is-it-time-for-the-jews-to-leave-europe/386279/">Is it time for the Jews to leave Europe?</a><br />
I debated a lot over whether to include this article in the newsletter. My opinion on this article is influenced by confirmation bias. Although the author&rsquo;s opinions go further than my own on this issue, if you put us in a room, we&rsquo;d probably agree on many things. That being said, this article conveys something which matters to me and that’s why I’m including it here. The article&rsquo;s provocative. It appeals to emotion and pulls statistics from Jewish populations of the countries it surveys. It&rsquo;s the antithesis of a dry, just the facts Economist article.</p>

<h1 id="the-mind">The Mind</h1>

<p><a href="http://prime.nautil.us/issue/13/symmetry/how-to-learn-to-love-your-doppleganger">How to Learn to Love your Doppleganger</a><br />
A short but interesting survey of circumstances leading to individuals hallucinating their doppleganger. I&rsquo;m fascinated by abnormal brain configurations and unusual coping mechanisms. I wish the author had delved more into the topic. I&rsquo;ve included a few articles about hallucination and the mind in past newsletters but none of them have captured the essence of what interests me most about these phenomena. I&rsquo;ll keep looking but please send me any good material you know of related to this topic. I&rsquo;m looking for something that treats hallucination analytically rather than clinically and gets at the implications of such phenomena for theories of mind.</p>

<h1 id="education">Education</h1>

<p><a href="http://www.theguardian.com/education/2015/mar/11/revolution-changing-way-your-child-taught">The revolution that’s changing the way your child is taught</a><br />
In the same vein as the Charisma Hacker article I included a few weeks back, this piece looks at one man&rsquo;s mission to dissect what differentiates great teachers from average ones. Doug Lemov, the man behind this movement, wants to take what he learns and distill it into a teachable formula for teachers everywhere. When I read this article, I immediately thought of one of my idols, Tim Ferriss, a man who&rsquo;s spent his career analyzing the habits, tricks, and behaviors of top performers in an attempt to replicate them and teach them. On a more personal note, good teachers have had a profound effect on my life and my intuition is that large scale improvements in teachers will reap huge benefits.</p>

<h1 id="the-future">The Future</h1>

<p><a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-03-09/google-ventures-bill-maris-investing-in-idea-of-living-to-500">Google Ventures and the Search for Immortality</a><br />
An inspiring look Bill Maris, the man behind Google Ventures and his goals. As life sciences&rsquo; funding shifts from the government to the private sector, people like Maris will increasingly determine what ideas get funded and developed.</p>

<h1 id="other-contributions">Other Contributions</h1>

<p><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/08/business/economy/at-the-fed-in-2009-rolling-dice-in-a-crisis.html?ref=todayspaper">At the Fed in 2009, Rolling the Dice in a Crisis</a> (Will Baird)<br />
This article outlines the debates on how best to aid the recovery at the Federal Reserve Board&rsquo;s meetings immediately following the &lsquo;08 financial crisis. While the author shares my take-away that the Fed basically improvised its post-crisis response, she finds this less horrifying than I do. She also seems to think it somehow possible that the Fed can do better next time, despite acknowledging that it did not see the &lsquo;08 crash coming. Despite these interpretive differences, I think the article is worth the read.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/08/opinion/sunday/if-an-algorithm-wrote-this-how-would-you-even-know.html">If an algorithm wrote this, how would you even know?</a> (Steph Sa)<br />
Discusses algorithmic article generation, a fast-growing new market. I highly recommend you take the quiz linked to at the end of the article. Full disclosure, I failed miserably.</p>
