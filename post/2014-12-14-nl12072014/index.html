<section><h1 id="on-writing">On Writing</h1>
<p><a href="http://paw.princeton.edu/issues/2014/11/12/pages/3295/index.xml">Writing with the Master</a><br>
Profiles John McPhee, a staff writer for the New Yorker and professor at
Princeton. Uses accounts from McPhee&rsquo;s students to illustrate his
erudition.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2010/02/08/the-patch">The Patch by John McPhee</a><br>
As a companion to the profile of John McPhee, I&rsquo;ve included this piece
of his. In an attempt to understand better the reverence with which his
students speak of him, I read three of his past New Yorker articles. &ldquo;The
Patch&rdquo; struck me as the most appropriate. I hope you like it.</p>
<h1 id="food-and-food-production">Food and Food Production</h1>
<p><a href="http://www.nationalgeographic.com/foodfeatures/evolution-of-diet/">Evolution of Diet</a><br>
Examines traditional diets of various indigenous cultures.
Discusses how these diets can inform the development of a modern diet
that is both healthy and sustainable. Avoids
dogma and keeps the reader engaged.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.nationalgeographic.com/foodfeatures/green-revolution/">The Next Green Revolution</a><br>
Surveys the different ways agricultural yields could
increase to accommodate increasing populations. Eclipses other articles
on this topic by
balancing differing opinions on what agricultural
technologies will lead to the best future.
Tidbits about Juma, a cassava farmer from Tanzania, complement the more
scientific aspects of the article.</p>
<h1 id="banking">Banking</h1>
<p><a href="http://dealbook.nytimes.com//2014/12/13/small-bank-in-kansas-is-a-financial-testing-ground/">Small Bank in Kansas is a Financial Testing Ground</a><br>
Discusses how a small bank in Kansas combines a traditional bank
model with innovative uses of technology to serve its customers better.
This approach falls short of the &ldquo;disruption&rdquo; championed by Silicon
Valley elites, but nevertheless represents a valuable means of
modernizing outdated systems.</p>
<h1 id="torture">Torture</h1>
<p><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/12/10/world/senate-intelligence-committee-cia-torture-report.html?_r=0">Panel Faults C.I.A. Over Brutality and Deceit in Terrorism
Investigations</a><br>
Summarizes the recently-released Senate report on C.I.A. interrogation tactics, the hearings following its release, and the C.I.A&rsquo;s response to the report. Although this article displays a mild bias in favor of the Senate report, it manages to cover the main sides of the debate.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.weeklystandard.com/articles/tortured-report_821202.html?nopager=1">A Tortured Report</a><br>
Argues that the Senate report both understates the effectiveness of the
interrogation techniques employed and omits parts of the truth in order
to protect Democratic Party higher-ups from potential fallout.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.salon.com/2014/12/11/exclusive_corrupt_toxic_and_sociopathic_glenn_greenwald_unloads_on_torture_cia_and_washingtons_rotten_soul/">Glenn Greenwald Salon Interview</a><br>
Glenn Greenwald, known primarily for authoring the
Guardian&rsquo;s original article about Edward Snowden&rsquo;s leaking
information about the NSA, argues that
the C.I.A&rsquo;s employment of torture and the accompanying cover-up reflect intrinsic corruption in Washington&rsquo;s political and media
estates.</p>
<h1 id="other-contributions">Other Contributions</h1>
<p><a href="http://yorkandfig.com/#post-228">York and Fig: At the Intersection of Change</a> (Matt Ritter)<br>
Provides interesting perspectives on the individuals that led the
gentrification of Highland Park, Los Angeles. Presents a generally
unbiased viewpoint about an issue that advocates on all sides painfully
distort.</p>
<p>However, the author overlooked certain positive changes resulting from
gentrification,
including the inevitable reduction in crime. He also neglected to explore the possibility that
vandals targeted the gay couple partly due to their sexuality.</p>
<p>Further discussion of the economic factors behind gentrification would
have enhanced the article.
For example, an exploration of the relationship between gentrification
and widespread rent control in Los Angeles would have been enlightening.</p>

Explains how the view count of &ldquo;Gangam Style&rdquo; managed to exceed YouTube&rsquo;s View Counter
integer limit. Elucidates the mathematics behind the bug simply and
succinctly.</p>
