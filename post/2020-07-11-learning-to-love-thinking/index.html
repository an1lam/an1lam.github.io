<p><strong>Inspiration</strong>: <a href="https://nabeelqu.co/understanding">Understanding</a> by Nabeel Qureshi.</p>

<p>One commonality I&rsquo;ve noticed amongst biographies and auto-biographies of thinkers I respect&ndash;Richard Feynman, John Von Neumann, John Carmack, David Deutsch, Donald Knuth, George Church&ndash;is that these folks enjoy(ed) thinking for its own sake. Concrete examples include:
- Feynman&rsquo;s famous story about burning out and then thinking about spinning plates in the cafeteria leading him to develop Feynam diagrams and QED.
- Every Von Neumann story that involves someone proposing some problem and him spending seconds/minutes (Von Neumann was an alien) solving it.
- David Deutsch tweeting about <a href="https://twitter.com/DavidDeutschOxf/status/949243539451531264">fun</a> (also <a href="https://twitter.com/DavidDeutschOxf/status/949016634009817089">here</a>) as a necessary condition for &lsquo;good&rsquo; research.
- John Conway&rsquo;s discoveries coming from playing games.
This perspective and way of approaching learning is somewhat foreign to me. I definitely like learning, but I often lack the patience to fiddle around with things for fun to the degree the people I mentioned do. Working as an engineer also instilled a strong &ldquo;is it useful?&rdquo; sense in me that I struggle to quell.</p>

<p>Recently, I&rsquo;ve been questioning whether my fear of wasting time and going down rabbit holes is holding me back. In this post, I hope to interrogate some of the factors that led me to have this perspective in the first place and try and figure out whether I need to change.</p>

<h2 id="identity-as-an-engineer">Identity as an engineer</h2>

<p>In my first year as a software engineer, I viewed my bias towards speed and usefulness as a strength. When I started working, I had a deep insecurity around being able to produce and deliver which led me to want to prove that I could deliver quickly and effectively. For example, I distinctly remember worrying that my standup updates wouldn&rsquo;t seem substantial enough and that people would start to think of me as unproductive. During this time, I also saw how some of my peers could more deeply understand all the details of a system or new technology but took longer to accomplish tasks. Related to the former, there were a few instances in which I&rsquo;d prepare for a group discussion and I&rsquo;d get asked a series of &ldquo;why?&rdquo; questions that I quickly became unable to answer. While my embarrassment in these situations taught me to go deeper, it also reinforced my notion that learning things deeply wasn&rsquo;t my comparative advantage. On ther other hand, because I started out so focused on delivering, some of my early work successes came from deciding to ignore non-essentials and relentlessly focus on a few key goals. Especially since these experiences involved praise from senior people, they strengthened my developing self-image as somehow who Got Things Done rather than deeply understood them.</p>

<p>While it may sound like I was hyper self-aware of my values and their influence on my behavior, if you had asked me at the end of 2017 what it meant to be a good engineer, I wouldn&rsquo;t have said &ldquo;good engineers get shit done and don&rsquo;t waste time understanding things.&rdquo;   at the time I was only partially aware of these values. It wasn&rsquo;t like I was going around talking about delivering</p>

<p>Fortunately, after a year and a half, my need to constantly prove that I could do things calmed down and I got the opportunity to work with senior engineers who wouldn&rsquo;t settle for anything less than deep understanding. Seeing people I respected take the time to learn things and do them right showed me that one could be productive while going deep on</p>
