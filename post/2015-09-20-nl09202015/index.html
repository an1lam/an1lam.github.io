<section><h2 id="cryonics">Cryonics</h2>
<p><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2015/09/13/us/cancer-immortality-cryogenics.html">A Dying Young Woman’s Hope in Cryonics and a Future</a><br>
Cancer claimed Kim Suozzi at age 23, but she chose to have her brain preserved with the dream that neuroscience might one day revive her mind. I really enjoyed this article. Unlike many of the readers, I&rsquo;ve considered signing up for cryonics and went so far as to ask for it for my birthday (a request which my mother politely denied). I share Souzzi&rsquo;s sentiments almost entirely, so it was touching to see the support she gathered on the internet. Despite this, I&rsquo;ve had discussions with friends and family members who disagree with me strongly, so I understand the other perspective. Given this, I wanted to provide two articles that present my own and the opposing perspective on this topic. The following two articles dig deeper into scientific and philosophical views on this issue.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.technologyreview.com/view/541311/the-false-science-of-cryonics/">About That Brain-Freezing Cryonics Story in the New York Times</a><br>
Neuroscientist Michael Hendricks argues that cryonics companies sell snake oil. The author cites his own neuroscience research as evidence that we are nowhere near preserving the brain in such a way that it can eventually be revived.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.brainpreservation.org/ken-hayworths-personal-response-to-mit-technology-review-article/">Ken Hayworth’s personal response to MIT Technology Review article</a><br>
Ken Hayworth, a neuroscientist mentioned in the original NY Times article, responds to the the Technology Review article, arguing against its scientific and philosophical arguments.</p>
<p>I largely agree with Ken Hayworth. His evidence that we are moving in the direction of being able to preserve full brains makes sense to me. On the philosophy side, whenever I hear arguments stating that we can&rsquo;t be copied, I think of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ship_of_Theseus">Ship of Theseus paradox</a>. This thought experiment convinced me that any arguments against replicating the brain rely on false intuitions more than actual logic.</p>
<h2 id="biotech">Biotech</h2>
<p><a href="http://nautil.us/issue/12/feedback/this-iconoclast-injected-life-into-artificial-body-parts">This Iconoclast Injected Life Into Artificial Body Parts</a><br>
Profiles Laura Niklason, a scientist who spent 20 years working to grow functioning blood vessels in a lab. Niklason overcame skepticism from the scientific community and pioneered an approach to blood vessel growth that mimics mechanical stresses from the human body. I&rsquo;ve noticed a trend in the newsletter articles about famous scientists and mathematicians &ndash; they all seem to fight against institutional skepticism towards their idea. While some might see this as depressing, I see it as uplifting. Every time someone tells me my idea is stupid, I can think of the good company I&rsquo;m in. If these people, who are much smarter than me, overcame this much opposition, maybe I can too. Of course, the problem with this logic is that, often times, these doubters are right.</p>
<p><a href="http://motherboard.vice.com/read/the-math-that-shows-humans-could-live-ten-times-longer">The Math That Shows Humans Could Live Ten Times Longer</a><br>
The paper discussed in this article asserts that we’ve made false assumptions about the aging process. The authors of this paper argue that aging, rather than resulting from a steady process of decay, has been “programmed” into our genetic code. I’m incredibly excited about this research.   I’ve known about this alternative hypothesis for the aging process since I discovered the work of Josh Mitteldorf, but seeing it here makes me more confident that we can use this new understanding to actually slow or even cure aging.</p>
<h2 id="future-of-housing">Future of Housing</h2>
<p><a href="http://www.theguardian.com/cities/2015/sep/16/anarchism-community-walter-segal-self-build-south-london-estate">Life in Walter Segal&rsquo;s self-build &lsquo;anarchist&rsquo; estate</a><br>
Profiles a set of affordable homes in England that the author believes are a good model for the future of affordable housing. These homes, built by Walter Segal, are lightweight, simple, can be built by homeowners with minimal help, and are easily modifiable.</p>
