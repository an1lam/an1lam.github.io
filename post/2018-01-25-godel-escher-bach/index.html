<section><p>How much do isomorphisms play a role in our understanding of abstract concepts?
&gt; Sometimes it is helpful to think of the LISP statements as mere pieces of data which are fed
&gt; sequentially to a constant running machine language program (the LISP interpreter). When you
&gt; think of things this way, you get a different image of the relation between a program written in
&gt; a higher-level language and the machine which is executing it.
- Hofstadter&rsquo;s other essay about analogy as the core of cognition.
- Hofstadter&rsquo;s a modern sort of Platonist (need quote from Bongard problems chapter).
- Include something about CJS Hayward&rsquo;s post about an abstract art of memory. Mention a disclaimer
  about Hayward&rsquo;s other posts.
- I wish I could talk to Hofstadter and ask him to what degree the isomorphisms and intuition
  proceeded the formalisms for him.
- Example of DNA going through the tape recorder.
&gt; Let us first give a picturesque image, and then render it more precise. Imagine the mRNA to be
&gt; like a long piece of magnetic recording tape, and the ribosome to be like a tape recorder. As the
&gt; tape passes through the playing head of the recorder, it is &ldquo;read&rdquo; and converted into music, or
&gt; other sounds. Thus magnetic markings are &ldquo;translated&rdquo; into notes. Similarly, when a &ldquo;tape&rdquo; of
&gt; mRNA passes through the &ldquo;playing head&rdquo; of a ribosome, the &ldquo;notes&rdquo; which are produced are <em>amino
&gt; acids</em>, and the &ldquo;pieces of music&rdquo; which they make up are <em>proteins</em>. (GEB, 519)
- Take this intriguing passage from an interview of Hofstadter as well.
&gt; Hofstadter had always been fascinated with how the mind works. He set out to teach himself
&gt; Euclidean geometry as an experiment, a way of observing the process of intellectual reasoning and
&gt; discovery. He used the humble triangle as his guinea pig. “I was so naive at the outset of my
&gt; many-year binge with geometry that I was caught off guard by the fact that the triangle had more
&gt; than one centre,” says Hofstatder. “I had heard the terms ‘orthocentre,’ or ‘centroid,’ and
&gt; ‘circumcentre.’ I sort of knew these things existed, but to tell the truth, when I found out that
&gt; any triangle has several centres, I was really thrown. It seemed like a miracle. In point of
&gt; fact, any triangle has an infinite number of centres, but they are not all equally interesting.”
&gt;
&gt; “One time,” Hofstadter continues, “I made an analogy to the human body.  Suppose I were to ask
&gt; various people, ‘What is the most important part of your body?’ One person might reply, ‘It’s my
&gt; brain.’ Somebody else might say, ‘No, it’s my stomach;’ somebody else might insist ‘my heart,’
&gt; ‘my sexual organs,’ or ‘my belly button’&hellip;.I became inflamed and impassioned in trying to invent
&gt; new geometrical notions. And I saw that the process of analogy-making lay at the core of all my
&gt; discoveries. I started noticing beautiful patterns not only in triangles and among triangle
&gt; centres, but there were exquisite patterns at the level of the ideas themselves.”
&gt;
&gt; Following his triangle experiment, Hofstadter returned to math with the intention of reclaiming
&gt; it. “I came back to group theory and Galois theory some thirty-five years later and I said, ‘By
&gt; god, I’m going to make this hateful stuff lovable.’  ” He started a course called Group Theory
&gt; and Galois Theory Visualized, though the running joke is that his approach is more like Pizza
&gt; Theory.  The visual metaphor Hofstadter uses to explain difficult group theory theorems such as
&gt; Zassenhaus’ lemma is simple circles with slices and concentric circles within, which look a lot
&gt; like pizzas. (It didn’t hurt either that he always brought pizzas to class.) Hofstadter’s
&gt; overriding conclusion from these intellectual experiments is that analogy-making plays a crucial
&gt; role in doing quality mathematics—analogies are what allow the illustration and conceptualization
&gt; and understanding of otherwise seemingly unfathomable ideas.</p>

<p>Is intelligence skimmable? Was the GOFAI goal to &ldquo;explain the high-level traffic of symbol
activation in its own terms (GEB, 358)&rdquo; misguided?</p>

<p>Is Hofstadter&rsquo;s comment about visualization arising as a result of simulated motor activity at all
proven?
&gt; What magic allows us to mesh two or three images, hardly giving a thought as to how we should do
&gt; it? Knowledge of how to do this is among the most procedural of all, for we have almost no
&gt; insight into what mental imagery is.
&gt;
&gt; It may be that imagery is based on our ability to suppress motor activity. By this, I mean the
&gt; following. If you imagine an orange, htere may occur in your cortex a set of commands to pick it
&gt; up, to smell it, to inspect it, and so on. Clearly these commands cannot be carried out, because
&gt; the orange is not there. But they can be sent along the usual channels towards the cerebellum or
&gt; other suborgans of the brain, until, at some critical point, a &ldquo;mental faucet&rdquo; is closed,
&gt; preventing them from actually being carried out. Depending on how far down the line this &ldquo;faucet&rdquo;
&gt; is situated, the images may be more or less vivid and real-seeming.</p>

<p>Does the fact that our brains are plastic change disprove or call into question Hofstadter&rsquo;s point
about the separation between software and hardware in brains?
&gt; We humans also have &ldquo;software&rdquo; and &ldquo;hardware&rdquo; aspects, and the difference is second nature to us.
&gt; We are used to the rigidity of our physiology: the fact that we cannot, at will, cure ourselves
&gt; of diseases, or grow hair of any color&ndash;to mention just a couple of simple examples. We can,
&gt; however, &ldquo;reprogram&rdquo; our minds so that we operate in new conceptual frameworks. The amazing
&gt; flexibility of our minds seems nearly irreconcilable with the notion that our brains must be made
&gt; out of fixed-rule hardware, which cannot be reprogrammed.
- Argument for: major improvements to thinking may correlate with physiological changes.
- Argument against: brain and perception shifts happen much too rapidly to require physiological
  change. Physiological change more likely correlates with lower level capabilities and solidified
  memory.</p>

<p>Have people solved the bootstrapping problem in biology?</p>
