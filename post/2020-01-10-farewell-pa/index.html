  <section><blockquote>
<p>The speaker next in line was a spiritual sage who was widely respected for his kindness and gentleness as well as for his devotion. As he strode to the podium, a small boy yelled out from the audience: “The dragon is bad!”</p>
<p>The boy’s parents turned bright red and began hushing and scolding the child. But the sage said, “Let the boy speak. He is probably wiser than an old fool like me.”</p>
<p>At first, the boy was too scared and confused to move. But when he saw the genuinely friendly smile on the sage’s face and the outreached hand, he obediently took it and followed the sage up to the podium. “Now, there’s a brave little man,” said the sage. “Are you afraid of the dragon?“</p>
<p>“I want my granny back,” said the boy.</p>
<p>“Did the dragon take your granny away?”</p>
<p>“Yes,” the boy said, tears welling up in his large frightened eyes. “Granny promised that she would teach me how to bake gingerbread cookies for Christmas. She said that we would make a little house out of gingerbread and little gingerbread men that would live in it. Then those people in white clothes came and took Granny away to the dragon… The dragon is bad and it eats people… I want my Granny back!”</p>
<p>At this point the child was crying so hard that the sage had to return him to his parents.</p>
<p>There were several other speakers that evening, but the child’s simple testimony had punctured the rhetorical balloon that the king’s ministers had tried to inflate. The people were backing the anti-dragonists, and by the end of the evening even the king had come to recognize the reason and the humanity of their cause. In his closing statement, he simply said: “Let’s do it!”</p></blockquote>

<p>If I had spoken Yehuda&rsquo;s eulogy I would not have comforted the mourners in their loss. I would have told the mourners that Yehuda had been absolutely annihilated, that there was nothing left of him. I would have told them they were right to be angry, that they had been robbed, that something precious and irreplaceable was taken from them, for no reason at all, taken from them and shattered, and they are never getting it back.</p>
<p>No sentient being deserves such a thing. Let that be my brother&rsquo;s true eulogy, free of comforting lies.</p></blockquote>

<p>I got a lot of things wrong as a child, but I&rsquo;ve always been incredibly proud that I started hating death early and never wavered, not even when adults told me that &ldquo;death was a part of life&rdquo; or spewed religious nonsense (to their credit, my parents never did this). Because of that, for as long as I can remember, I&rsquo;ve hated the euphemisms people use to describe death - &ldquo;passed on&rdquo;, &ldquo;in a better place&rdquo;, &ldquo;left us&rdquo;. As though every death is not a tragedy of epic proportions. No, I prefer to look the reality in the face as much as I can. I <em>want</em> to remember that every time a person dies, they&rsquo;re gone from the world. A little spark of mind extinguished <em>forever</em> (barring cryonics). Admittedly, sometimes it&rsquo;s hard, even for me, to keep in mind how many sparks we lose <em>every single day</em>.</p>
<p>Today&rsquo;s not one of those days. My Grandpa died last night, and all I can think about is that he&rsquo;s gone.</p>
<h1 id="memories">
Memories
<a href="#memories" class="heading-anchor">#</a>
</h1>
<p>I&rsquo;m blessed to have many good memories of time spent with my Grandpa.</p>
<p>I remember my Grandpa teaching me arithmetic tricks at the kitchen table of my house. Little things like how to easily <a href="https://www.cut-the-knot.org/arithmetic/rapid/Specifics/Product99.shtml">multiply by 9/99/etc.</a> At the time, I listened but didn&rsquo;t really internalize them, probably because of calculators. I now see how, for someone who grew up when my Grandpa did, those tricks formed a sort of intellectual currency amongst precocious kids. I like to imagine that in the same way that my friends and I show off to each other by sharing coding tricks or ideas we&rsquo;ve read, he and his friends presumably would one-up each other with tricks they&rsquo;d learned or invented.</p>
<p>I remember him giving me the back-issues of IEEE Spectrum that he received through his lifelong subscription. Each time he did, we&rsquo;d talk a little about it and he&rsquo;d mention all the cool stuff being done or an article he&rsquo;d liked, reminding me that he too was an engineer.</p>
<p>I remember him explaining how gyroscopes worked to me, and (I think) showing me a gyroscope he kept in the basement. Getting it spinning and explaining to me how it resisted movement. He clearly took pride in sharing what he worked on and knew with me.</p>
<p>In the movies, there&rsquo;s always a point after an important character dies where someone says, &ldquo;they&rsquo;re gone but still with us in our hearts.&rdquo; Echoing this cliche, I am incredibly grateful that I have so many fond memories of my Grandpa.</p>
<hr>
<p>However, the more I think about these memories, the more my thoughts also turn towards questions I have that I can never answer. Questions that reveal how much more I could have learned from him had he remained youthful as I grew into the person I am today.</p>
<p>I found some advanced math books in his library recently. Books on topics that I want to understand. Did he read them?</p>
<p>Like me, he was an engineer. What would it have been like to discuss his work or my work with him in his intellectual prime?</p>
<p>Did he entertain crazy ideas like I do? Did he play with them in his head?</p>
<p>Did his mind work the way mine does? Maybe my mental quirks came from his genes.</p>
<p>Did he take pride in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL2DB73589969D47AB">the pleasure of finding things out</a>?</p>
<p>I once told a few friends that I thought aging was one of the worst things in the world and one of them replied, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know if people are meant to live much longer than 100 years.&rdquo; At the time, I replied that 100 years is just an arbitrary number. What I should&rsquo;ve said was that that&rsquo;s the wrong question. The question&rsquo;s not what&rsquo;s the right number of years for someone to exist, it&rsquo;s what experiences do we value and want to allow people to have. I would&rsquo;ve liked to get to know my Grandpa more as he was when he was young, and I think he would&rsquo;ve liked to know me as I am now, number of years be damned.</p>
<p>My Grandpa lived a great life, but that doesn&rsquo;t change the fact that he&rsquo;s gone now and there&rsquo;s so much I&rsquo;ll never get to ask him.</p>
<h1 id="resolve">
Resolve
<a href="#resolve" class="heading-anchor">#</a>
</h1>
<p>I often used to wonder whether experiencing loss would cause me to reach for or wish I had some sort of spiritual beliefs to fall back on. Would the stark reality of a person existing in one moment and being gone the next simply overwhelm me and force me to seek solace in faith?</p>
<p>My mom&rsquo;s mother died when I was young. I thankfully have some memories of her but, for better or worse, don&rsquo;t remember her death and its impact on me. So, in a way, this is the first real death of a loved one I&rsquo;ve experienced.</p>
<p>As a result, I now know that the answer to my question is affirmatively no. Sitting here now, the prospect of embracing a religion or any view that cushions the impact of death does not appeal to me. In fact, the idea of doing so feels dirty. Like wrapping myself in a lie because I can&rsquo;t handle the truth.</p>
<p>However, it does leave me with a different feeling &ndash; resolve.</p>
<p>Recently, I&rsquo;ve often found myself explaining why I decided to leave my software engineering job and focus on the intersection between CS and bio. I typically answer with half-truths:</p>
<ul>
<li>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve always been interested in bio and the intersection of it with ML seemed interesting.&rdquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;I wanted to do something &lsquo;impactful&rsquo; and what&rsquo;s more important than health?&rdquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;Machine learning is so exciting and bio has so much data.&rdquo;</li>
</ul>
<p>But the tragedy of my Grandpa&rsquo;s death (and all the other deaths happening every day) has instilled me with the courage to admit the real answer that I&rsquo;ve been too timid to share, even with myself. I want to fight aging and death. I want to help figure out what causes humans to rot and die and fix it. And once we&rsquo;ve figured out the big stuff, then we fix the little stuff. And we keep going and going and going until death has no power.</p>
<p>I think I was scared to say this because it seems so presumptuous. Even writing it now, a little voice in my head mocks me, &ldquo;<em>You</em> think you can help change something that&rsquo;s existed for as long as humans have walked the Earth? You who knows so little, who struggles to learn things so many already know. You, who&rsquo;s already so old that you&rsquo;ll soon start getting dumber. How dare you purport to work on such a difficult problem. How dare you openly admit such arrogance. Not only will you will fail, you will be embarrassed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>That voice scares me, but then I think about the hundreds of thousands of people who die every year, all the people who age slowly and painfully, losing their faculties as they wither away. I think about their loved ones. And I realize: it&rsquo;s not about me, it&rsquo;s about <em>them</em>. I may fail spectacularly, but at least I&rsquo;ll have tried.</p>
<h1 id="conclusion">
Conclusion
<a href="#conclusion" class="heading-anchor">#</a>
</h1>
<p>As much as I dream that one day we will no longer lose so many, I also know that success won&rsquo;t bring back my Grandpa and the many others who&rsquo;ve already been lost. So, with no faith to fall back on, the best I can do is mourn, remember, and cherish the time I have left with my other two grandparents.</p>
<p>Goodbye, Grandpa. You were a great man, and I&rsquo;ll miss you.</p>
