      <description>Intro Simpson&#39;s paradox is a phenomenon in statistics where a choice or treatment performs better in all sub-populations but worse in the overall population. Since first learning of Simpson&#39;s Paradox, I&#39;ve struggled to develop a gut-level understanding that lets me easily detect cases of it and clearly explain its cause. This is even after reading Michael Nielsen&#39;s wonderful post that provides a number of different ways of thinking about it and Judea Pearl&#39;s fascinating analysis of it from a causality perspective.</description>

      <description>Selected Exercises 1. Suppose we play a game where we start with $ c $ dollars. On each play of the game you either double or halve your money, with equal probability. What is your expected fortune after $ n $ trials?
I&#39;m pretty sure we can use a trick that I&#39;ve seen a lot in machine learning to solve this using plain old expectations. If I&#39;m right, we let $ X \sim \text{Binomial}(n, \frac{1}{2}) $ and can create a new random variable, $ Z $, where</description>

      <description>In which I record my thoughts on Network Mendelian Randomization by Burgess et al.
What is this paper about? This paper describes a method for doing Mendelian Randomization (MR) in the presence of a potential mediating variable. In the typical MR setting, we have an instrumental variable which &amp;ldquo;instruments&amp;rdquo; an exposure that we believe causally influences the outcome we care about. True mediators &amp;ldquo;mediate&amp;rdquo; the causal influence of exposures on outcomes.</description>

      <description>Matrix Potpourri As part of reviewing Linear Algebra for my Machine Learning class, I&#39;ve noticed there&#39;s a bunch of matrix terminology that I didn&#39;t encounter during my proof-based self-study of LA from Linear Algebra Done Right. This post is mostly intended to consolidate my own understanding and to act as a reference to future me, but if it also helps others in a similar position, that&#39;s even better!

      <description>In which I record my thoughts on Basset.
Bio Background The genome consists of (broadly) two types of genes, coding genes and noncoding genes. Coding genes get translated into proteins (as laid down by the Central Dogma) and are what most of us learned about in bio class. Non-coding genes&amp;hellip; don&#39;t. As I understand it, noncoding genes can do a bunch of different things, but part of their function is to regulate coding gene activity through a number of mechanisms.</description>

      <description>In which I record my thoughts on DeepBind.
What is this paper about? The authors of this paper designed a conv net model to predict how well different proteins will bind to sequences of DNA or RNA. They train one model per protein for many different sequences and show that these models can predict binding affinities for sequences well enough to produce insights regarding the impact of single nucleotide mutations. They then discuss different datasets and areas in which they tested their model and how it performed (often SOTA [as of 2015]).</description>

      <description>Meta: While I originally set out to write this essay about why I no longer &amp;ldquo;endorse&amp;rdquo; Stoicism as an operating framework, re-reading a bunch of Stoic stuff led me to realize that I still agree with ~90% of Stoic principles.
Peter Thiel recently talked about (in German) why he&#39;s not a Stoic,
 Stoics, for example, are obsessed with death. However, I am the opposite of a stoic, I loathe the peace and have no sense in the countryside to live and meditate on the environment.</description>

      <description>Selected Exercises 4. Suppose $m$ and $n$ are positive integers with $ m \leq n $, and suppose $ \lambda_1, \dots, \lambda_m \in F $. Prove that there exists a polynomial $ p \in \mathcal P(\mathbf{F}) $ with $ \deg p = n $ such that $ 0 = p(\lambda_1) = \cdots = p(\lambda_m) $ and such that $ p $ has no other zeros.
First, we can show that the polynomial $p&amp;rsquo;(z) = (z - \lambda_1) \cdots (z-\lambda_m) $ with $ \deg p&amp;rsquo; = m $ has $ 0 = p&amp;rsquo;(\lambda_1) = \cdots = p&amp;rsquo;(\lambda_m) $ and no other zeros.</description>

      <description>As I understand it, much of Coase&#39;s work focuses on why companies&amp;rsquo; internal structures don&#39;t resemble markets all that much. Instead, most firms have feudal-ish structures. The CEO has, at the discretion of the board, final decision making power on nearly all decisions, and then their power trickles down recursively to their subordinates for decisions in which they&#39;re not involved.
While I&#39;m willing to swallow the bitter pill that feudal-ish structures are actually more efficient for many company functions than democratic ones would be, in my own experience, I&#39;ve observed a few places where I think market-based decision making systems could improve both company efficiency and employee satisfaction.</description>

Alkjash describes babble and prune like this:
 Here’s a simplistic model of how this works. I try to build a coherent sentence. At each step, to pick the next word, I randomly generate words in the category (correct part of speech, relevance) and sound them out one by one to see which continues the sentence most coherently.</description>

      <description>This page tracks things about which I&#39;ve changed my mind over time and things about which I&#39;m still confused. For some things, there was one moment or event that caused me to revise my view.

Interestingly enough, none of the mind shifts listed here came about through me setting out to change my view.</description>

      <description>Summary This chapter introduces basic terminology and describes three separate experiments to introduce us to statistical methods in action.
We learn about the difference between randomized controlled experiments and observational experiments. A randomized controlled experiment is an experiment in which subjects are randomly assigned to two groups: experiment and control. Members of the experimental group receive the &amp;ldquo;treatment&amp;rdquo;, whereas members of the control do not. We expect that randomized controlled experiments minimize confounding &amp;ndash; other factors seeping in to impact our results without us knowing &amp;ndash; because we expect members of the experimental and control group to be on average the same outside of whatever difference the treatment produces.</description>

      <description>Seibel, James Hague and others have all tried to justify why code reading is so uncommon, and they make good points. But perhaps the conversation is led astray by use of the word read. I wonder if Abelson and the others would have had more examples if Seibel had asked them what code they had learned about for fun. Perhaps the word &amp;ldquo;read&amp;rdquo; put them in a passive frame of mind, caused them to filter out programs they&#39;d hacked on?</description>

Phenomenal piece that profiles an unconventional teacher in a poor Mexican border town. Uses this to broadly discuss the changing role and viewpoint on education. I&#39;m a total convert to the idea that children need to be allowed to explore rather than have information forced down their throats.

      <description>Key Concepts  Environments, Syntax, Programming Languages v. Natural Languages, Applicative Order of Operations  Environments  Understanding meaning is a matter of combining primitives with context.  Syntax  Lisp programmers tend to eschew syntactic sugar in favor of building their own syntax. Procedures are noticeably more composable than other languages I&#39;ve used previously. There&#39;s little difference between user-defined and language-defined procedures  Comparison between programming and natural languages  We can define procedures (verbs) and use variables (pronouns) to build higher-level abstractions.</description>

      <description>I&#39;ve been reading more technical neuroscience / psychology papers recently, so the newsletter reflects that. I&#39;m trying to better understand the variety and universality of mental imagery, and the only way to do that is to dive into the literature.
Mental Imagery Representing Exact Numbers Visually
This journal article discusses mental abacus representations. Be forewarned, the paper is fairly technical and a bit dry. If you just want to get the take-aways of the paper, I recommend reading the Introduction until you feel like you&#39;re in over your head and then skipping to page 13.</description>

      <description>Mind and Brain Below is a series of 4 articles that explore Julian Jaynes&amp;rsquo; theory of consciousness and its relationship to unusual minds. I found this series incredibly fascinating. It reminds me of Blindsight, a creepy sci-fi novel by Peter Watts that explores the relationship between self-awareness and intelligence. If you&#39;ve ever questioned the nature of consciousness, you&#39;ll enjoy this series. After reading this, I&#39;m committing to reading Julian Jaynes&amp;rsquo; Origin of Consciousness in the Breakdown of the Bicaemral Mind.</description>

The following quote sums up the article well:
 So the idea that we could play god and tamper with the laws of nature, creating things that wouldn’t otherwise exist, is a red herring?
We’re playing god every day. As the English philosopher Thomas Hobbes said, the natural state for human beings is a life that’s nasty, brutish, and short. We play god when we vaccinate.</description>

Evolution Defending Darwin
A biology professor at the University of Kentucky discusses his experiencing teaching evolution to a group largely composed of Creationists. This article interests me on two levels: 1) I come from an area where evolution is largely unchallenged. In school, I don&#39;t ever recall one of my peers arguing with the teacher about evolution, so it&#39;s interesting to read about a place where this is not the case.</description>

Memory Memory in the Flesh
Explores research on the radical idea that memory can exist outside the brain in other parts of the body. This article&#39;s interesting because it shows how political science can be.

      <description>Genocide Interview with a Torturer
An author and survivor of the Khmer Rouge genocide in Cambodia attempts to come to terms with his experience. At times, this piece was hard to read at times, but I think that quality adds to its power. This quote really resonated with me:
 &amp;quot;There’s a contemporary notion that we’re all potential torturers. This fatalism tinged with smugness exercises literature, film, and certain intellectuals. After all what’s more exciting than a great criminal?</description>

 &amp;quot;It makes me wonder that we all have these voices to some degree, but that it&#39;s rarer to have them be so articulate, so able to enunciate distinct aspects of our personalities.</description>

The film and source essay (linked to at the bottom of the page) both convey a philosophy rooted in Taoism, but understandable for the modern American. It&#39;s important to note that William S.

The first article about Stoicism in this newsletter, Indifference is a power, reveals Stoicism&#39;s tenets and discusses its application both by its founders during Roman times and in modern cognitive behavioral therapy (the creator of Cognitive Behavioral Therapy struggled as a psychoanalyst until he remembered the teachings of ancient Stoicism, citation.</description>

Moreover, wu wei also resembles a state of mind which modern psychologists label &amp;ldquo;flow&amp;rdquo;. In addition to defining wu wei, the article offers a compelling hypothesis for why alcohol frequently accompanies business deal dinners, a phenomenon which I had never thought to explain.</description>

      <description>Synthetic biology is a burgeoning discipline that stems from a long lineage of genetic meddling. Synthetic biology&#39;s ancestral legacy began when man first selected which seeds to plant based on the traits of the plants that birthed them. In Regenesis by George Church, Church takes the reader through this lineage, canvassing the past thousands of years and then focusing in on the past 30.
Church does a good job of balancing technical explanations with interesting anecdotes in the book.</description>

      <description>Mind-blowing, challenging, and disturbing at times, David Brin&#39;s view of the future is more comprehensive and more diverse than any other writer&#39;s. The thing I love about this book is that it doesn&#39;t shy away from discussing hard truths, like the myriad failure-modes humanity can enter. However, it accompanies this discussion with a constant sense that, if it&#39;s possible, humanity will find a way.

Philosophy Marathon Monks of Mt. Hiei
Disclaimer: There is New-Agey-ness within this article. For a more accurate depiction of the Marathon Monks, I recommend this documentary or this book (I intend to consume both over winter break)

What does this theory predict that others don&#39;t?</description>
