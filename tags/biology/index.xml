      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m experimenting with writing some shorter, less polished posts. These come with the disclaimer that I&amp;rsquo;m optimizing for getting thoughts out there while they&amp;rsquo;re still crystallizing rather than achieving maximum rigor. For this post in particular, I&amp;rsquo;m not arguing that this direction is definitely worth pursuing so much as exploring a frame/idea to see where it gets me.
A while ago, a friend asked me why I like the idea of working with cells better than cell-free systems and I gave some hand-wavy answer about cells being cool.</description>

      <description>What are continuous glucose monitors good for? More broadly, what are continuous measures of physiology (CxM) good for?
Similar to Elliot and I&amp;rsquo;s dialogue, this post has an unconventional format. It&amp;rsquo;s both a synthesis of Willy&amp;rsquo;s, Eryney&amp;rsquo;s, and my opinions on continuous monitoring combined with a debate in places where we disagree. To try and make it clear which views are coming from each person, we&amp;rsquo;ve annotated sections that come from a subset of us rather than all of us with e.</description>

      <description>Summary # Gene editing has made a lot of progress over the past few decades. CRISPR-Cas9 sparked the recent fervor and won some of its early pioneers a Nobel Prize, and more recently Prime Editing and Cytosine/Adenine Base Editors (CBEs/ABEs) have further expanded the range of editing targets and types of edits that are possible while increasing efficiency and reducing the rate of off-target effects.
From the perspective of safe, ubiquitous editing in humans using these systems, a few major challenges for editing remain towards translating novel target discovery into clinical application:</description>
