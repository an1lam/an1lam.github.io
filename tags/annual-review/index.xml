      <description>Introduction # A few months ago, Elliot Hershberg, one of my favorite Substack writers, wrote a post laying out his personal mission. I really enjoyed his post and, as is customary in blogging, the best way I could think of to compliment it was to share some (hopefully constructively) critical thoughts on it.

      <description>2022 was another exciting, fun year. To round it out, I wrote up some scattered reflections. Enjoy, or if you aren&amp;rsquo;t a fan of this genre of post, don&amp;rsquo;t! Also, each section is mostly self-contained and they&amp;rsquo;re not organized in any special order, so don&amp;rsquo;t hesitate to skip a section if it sounds boring.
Writing # 2022 felt like a productive year for blogging even though my post count dropped down from 11 in 2021 to 6.</description>
