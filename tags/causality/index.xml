I think this may relate to factor models.    Advanced Data Analysis from an Elementary Point of View (Ch. 18-23) Chapter 18 Exercises 18.2. Proof that every path must go through a collider:
Observe that every path between two exogenous variables starts with variables going in the opposite direction.</description>

      <description>Summary Detailed Notes 3 IV Requirements  IV must have a direct influence on the treatment IV must not covary with the unmeasured confounding that impacts the outcome IV must not have a direct influence on the outcome  Relevant considerations for deciding whether to do an IV analysis   Is there any unmeasured confounding?
 If not, is the answer that we can just use a normal regression?    When is unmeasured confounding especially likely?</description>
