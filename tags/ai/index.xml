      <description>This post was co-authored with Austin Vernon.
Summary While the internet often focuses its furious debate energy on decentralization in the realm of bits, in the realm of atoms, decentralization is currently underrated in terms of its feasibility and desirability. New technologies in areas like aviation, freight, and life sciences can and are shifting the scales towards decentralized models being possible. This has the potential to broaden access, reduce costs, and increase individual empowerment.</description>

      <description>As a way to keep myself honest, I&amp;rsquo;m going to be recording GPT4 predictions here and archiving versions of the post so I can&amp;rsquo;t go back and change it without people knowing. Not that I would do this anyway, but it&amp;rsquo;s been a tough week for &amp;ldquo;trust me, I&amp;rsquo;m telling the truth&amp;rdquo; so I&amp;rsquo;m doing this in case readers want the receipts.

      <title>AI Omens: Signs of AI acceleration</title>

      <description>A friend recently asked me what my &amp;ldquo;AI timelines&amp;rdquo; were. Especially with recent progress in image generation, language modeling, code generation, robotics, protein folding, and other areas, this has become an increasingly popular question amongst those who are paying attention.
However, I find trying to answer this question pretty frustrating. There already exist long, thorough reports (another) which build quantitative models and carefully define terms to make sure there&amp;rsquo;s as little ambiguity as possible.</description>
