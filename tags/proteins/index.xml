      <description>_This is the second post in a series introducing protein language models. The other posts are:
 Protein Language Models (Part 1): Introduction &amp;amp; Datasets Protein Language Models (Part 2): Models Protein Language Models (Part 3): Benchmarks &amp;amp; Evaluation Protein Language Models (Part 4): Scaling Protein Language Models (Part 5): FAQ &amp;amp; Conclusion  This post focuses on the different types of PLMs with a specific focus on deviations from the standard LLM playbook.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m experimenting with Lilian Weng style review blog posts on topics I wish I&amp;rsquo;d had someone to explain to me when I got started in protein machine learning.
Following the success of large sequence models in language and other domain, The terminology people use here is extremely confusing. &amp;ldquo;Large language models&amp;rdquo; often denote large sequence models trained on language and other modalities or in some cases just other modalities. In the rest of the post, I&amp;rsquo; use &amp;ldquo;large language models&amp;rdquo; (LLMs) to refer to the cluster of ideas around large-scale pretraining combined with simple objectives as opposed to models that focus on language as a modality and &amp;ldquo;protein language models&amp;rdquo; (PLMs) to refer to large sequence models of proteins.</description>
