      <description>Matrix Potpourri As part of reviewing Linear Algebra for my Machine Learning class, I&#39;ve noticed there&#39;s a bunch of matrix terminology that I didn&#39;t encounter during my proof-based self-study of LA from Linear Algebra Done Right. This post is mostly intended to consolidate my own understanding and to act as a reference to future me, but if it also helps others in a similar position, that&#39;s even better!
Note: I list all the sources from which I drew while writing this post under the &amp;ldquo;Sources&amp;rdquo; heading at the bottom of this post.</description>
