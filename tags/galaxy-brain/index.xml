      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m experimenting with writing some shorter, less polished posts. These come with the disclaimer that I&amp;rsquo;m optimizing for getting thoughts out there while they&amp;rsquo;re still crystallizing rather than achieving maximum rigor. For this post in particular, I&amp;rsquo;m not arguing that this direction is definitely worth pursuing so much as exploring a frame/idea to see where it gets me.
A while ago, a friend asked me why I like the idea of working with cells better than cell-free systems and I gave some hand-wavy answer about cells being cool.</description>
