      <description>As a way to keep myself honest, I&amp;rsquo;m going to be recording GPT4 predictions here and archiving versions of the post so I can&amp;rsquo;t go back and change it without people knowing. Not that I would do this anyway, but it&amp;rsquo;s been a tough week for &amp;ldquo;trust me, I&amp;rsquo;m telling the truth&amp;rdquo; so I&amp;rsquo;m doing this in case readers want the receipts.

      <title>AI Omens: Signs of AI acceleration</title>

      <description>A friend recently asked me what my &amp;ldquo;AI timelines&amp;rdquo; were. Especially with recent progress in image generation, language modeling, code generation, robotics, protein folding, and other areas, this has become an increasingly popular question amongst those who are paying attention.
However, I find trying to answer this question pretty frustrating. There already exist long, thorough reports (another) which build quantitative models and carefully define terms to make sure there&amp;rsquo;s as little ambiguity as possible.</description>

      <title>2050 Predictions</title>

      <description>Introduction # Along with a few internet blogger friends, inspired by Erik Hoel&amp;rsquo;s post (parts of which I disagree with, including the headline), I&amp;rsquo;ve decided to make predictions for 2050. The rest of this post discusses some meta aspects of making these predictions and then lists out the predictions. In case you&amp;rsquo;re waiting for my (hopefully) less speculative 2022 annual predictions, fear not! Those will be coming in the next few weeks.</description>

      <description>At the beginning of last year, I made predictions for the year. Now it&amp;rsquo;s time to score them (before I make my 2022 predictions).
Data &amp;amp; code # Here is a spreadsheet containing my scored predictions. If you want to see my full analysis, you can look at my Jupyter notebook which contains Brier score calculations plus plotting.
High level analysis # The key metrics I looked at were my overall and by category Brier scores plus calibration.</description>

      <title>2021 Predictions</title>

      <description>For the past two years, my friends have had a tradition of making predictions and scoring them at the end of the year. This year, I decided why not just post my predictions on my blog and score them publicly (with a few redacted)? This will hopefully incentivize me to be more thoughtful about them and also will help direct my endless desire for internet acclaim towards something that has a positive side effect.</description>
