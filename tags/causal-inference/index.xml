      <description>Attention conservation notice: Narrow target audience - will only make sense to people somewhat familiar with causal inference who don&amp;rsquo;t find the result entirely boring.
The Front-Door Criterion Suppose we have a causal graphical model that looks like the following.
Assume $ U $ is unmeasured whereas $ X, M, Y $ can be measured. Notice that:
 All directed paths from $ X $ to $ Y $ flow through $ M $.</description>

      <description>Causal Inference in Statistics Questions  Why is the causal effect identifiable in an IV DAG when the dependencies are linear (from an SCM perspective)?  I think this may relate to factor models.   Advanced Data Analysis from an Elementary Point of View (Ch. 18-23) Chapter 18 Exercises 18.2. Proof that every path must go through a collider:
Observe that every path between two exogenous variables starts with variables going in the opposite direction.</description>
